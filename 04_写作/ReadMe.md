## ▲ ChatGPT 4.0 翻译句子及解析

*Added: 2024.02.01*

### △ 随着季节的变化，景观完全变了。

最常用英文翻译可能是：**As the seasons change, the landscape transforms completely.**

这里的翻译使用了以下元素：

1. **主语和谓语**：“As the seasons change” 是一个**时间状语从句**，用来说明主句发生的时间背景。这里的主语是 "the seasons"（季节），而谓语是 "change"（变化），表示季节的更迭。

2. **主句**：“the landscape transforms completely” 是主句，描述了随着季节的变化，景观发生了怎样的变化。这里的主语是 "the landscape"（景观），而谓语是 "transforms"（转变），"completely"（完全地）用作副词，强调变化的程度。

3. **连词**：“As” 作为连词，用来引导时间状语从句，表明两个动作（季节的变化和景观的转变）是同时发生的。

这种翻译方式比较直接地传达了原文的意思，同时保持了语句的流畅性和清晰度。在这个句子中，"change" 和 "transform" 分别用来描绘季节的变化和景观的变化，传达了原文“消逝”和“改变”的意境。

| Is there anything on your mind?          | 你心里有什么事吗？     | 您有什么想说的吗？ | 比较随意友好，适合朋友间使用。<br />暗示对方可能有心事或想法要分享。 |

**出太陽  / 炎熱 **

簡單的 nice (美好的) 或 warm (溫暖的)、sunny (陽光普照)、clear (晴朗的) 都可以形容好天氣。
再炎熱一點就用 scorching (灼熱的)、burning (燃燒的)、sweltering (極熱的) 加強形容熱 (hot) 的程度。

A: It’s clear and scorching (hot) outside. Don’t forget your sunscreen. (外面萬里無雲而且超熱，你別忘了防曬。)

Carl Gustav Jung `/kɑːl ˈɡʊstɑːv jʊŋ/` ([/jʊŋ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [*YUUNG*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key);[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-:2-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-2) German: [[kaʁl ˈjʊŋ\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German); 26 July 1875 – 6 June 1961) was a Swiss [psychiatrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist), [psychotherapist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapist) and [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist) who founded the school of [analytical psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology).[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-5) He was a prolific author, illustrator, and correspondent, and a complex and controversial character, perhaps best known through his "autobiography" *[Memories, Dreams, Reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections).*[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-6)
**卡尔・古斯塔夫・荣格** （ [/jʊŋ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) ; 1875 年 7 月 26 日至 1961 年 6 月 6 日）是一位瑞士 [精神病学家](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist)、[心理治疗师](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapist)和[心理学家](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist)，创立了[分析心理学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology)派。 [[ a \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-5) 他是一位多产的作家、插画家和通讯员，也是一个复杂而有争议的人物，也许最出名的是他的 “自传” *[《回忆、梦想、反思》](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memories,_Dreams,_Reflections) 。* [[ 5 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-6)

Jung's work has been influential in the fields of [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry), [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology), [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology), [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology),[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-7) and [religious studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies). He worked as a research scientist at the [Burghölzli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burghölzli) psychiatric hospital, in [Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zürich), under [Eugen Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler). Jung established himself as an influential mind, developing a friendship with [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud), founder of [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis), conducting a [lengthy correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freud/Jung_Letters) paramount to their joint vision of human psychology. Jung is widely regarded as one of the most influential psychologists in history.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-8)[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-9)
荣格的著作在[精神病学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry)、[人类学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology)、[考古学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology)、[文学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature)、[哲学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy)、[心理学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology)[[ 6 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-7) 和 [宗教研究](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_studies)领域都具有影响力。他在[苏黎世](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zürich) [Burghölzli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burghölzli) 精神病院担任研究科学家，师从 [Eugen Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler) 。荣格确立了自己作为一个有影响力的思想家的地位，他与 [精神分析学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis)创始人[西格蒙德・弗洛伊德](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud)建立了友谊，并进行了[长篇通信](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freud/Jung_Letters)，这对他们对人类心理学的共同愿景至关重要。荣格被广泛认为是历史上最有影响力的心理学家之一。 [[ 7 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-8) [[ 8 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-9)

Freud saw the younger Jung not only as the heir he had been seeking to take forward his "new science" of psychoanalysis, but as a means to legitimize his own work: Freud and other contemporary psychoanalysts were Jews facing rising antisemitism in Europe, and Jung was [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians).[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-10) Freud secured Jung's appointment as president of Freud's newly founded [International Psychoanalytical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Psychoanalytical_Association). Jung's research and personal vision, however, made it difficult to follow his older colleague's doctrine and they parted ways. This division was painful for Jung and resulted in the establishment of Jung's analytical psychology, as a comprehensive system separate from psychoanalysis. Scholar [Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayim_Yerushalmi) believed Jung's later antisemitic remarks may be a clue to the schism.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-11)
弗洛伊德不仅将年轻的荣格视为他一直在寻求的精神分析 “新科学” 的继承人，而且将其视为使自己的工作合法化的一种手段：弗洛伊德和其他当代精神分析学家都是面临欧洲反犹太主义抬头的犹太人，而荣格是[基督徒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians)。 [[ 9 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-10) 弗洛伊德确保荣格被任命为弗洛伊德新成立的 [国际精神分析协会](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Psychoanalytical_Association)主席。然而，荣格的研究和个人愿景使得他很难遵循他年长同事的学说，于是他们分道扬镳。这种划分对荣格来说是痛苦的，并导致荣格分析心理学的建立，作为一个独立于精神分析的综合体系。学者[约瑟夫・哈伊姆・耶鲁沙米（Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi）](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayim_Yerushalmi)认为，荣格后来的反犹太主义言论可能是分裂的线索。 [[ 10 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-11)

Among the central concepts of analytical psychology is [individuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation#Carl_Jung)—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation of the self out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered it to be the main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including [synchronicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity), [archetypal phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes), the [collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious), the [psychological complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology)), and [extraversion and introversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion). His belief that some alcoholics may recover if they have a "spiritual or religious experience" led, in part, to the founding of [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous).[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-12) Jung was an [artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist), [craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan), builder, and prolific writer. Many of his works were not published until after his death and some remain unpublished.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-13)
分析心理学的核心概念之一是[个体化](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuation#Carl_Jung) —— 将自我从每个个体的有意识和无意识元素中分化出来的终生心理过程。荣格认为这是人类发展的主要任务。他创造了一些最著名的心理学概念，包括[同步性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity)、[原型现象](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes)、[集体无意识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious)、[心理复合体](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(psychology))以及[外向性和内向性](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion)。他相信一些酗酒者如果有 “精神或宗教经历” 可能会康复，这在一定程度上促成了[戒酒互诫协会](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous)的成立。 [[ 11 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-12) 荣格是一位 [艺术家](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist)、[工匠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan)、建筑商和多产作家。他的许多作品直到他去世后才出版，有些作品至今仍未出版。 [[ 12 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#cite_note-13)

![carl jung picture quote](./ReadMe.assets/carl-jung-picture-quote.jpg) 

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate. 
只有当你将无意识转化为意识，它才会指导你的生活，而你将称之为命运。



1. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
2. We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.
3. There is no coming to consciousness without pain.
4. The debt we owe to the play of imagination is incalculable.
5. Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.
6. Often the hands will solve a mystery that the intellect has struggled with in vain.
7. It all depends on how we look at things, and not how they are in themselves.
8. Great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity. They hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off.
9. A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them.
10. An understanding heart is everything in a teacher, and cannot be esteemed highly enough. One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feeling. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.
11. Where love rules, there is no will to power, and where power predominates, love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.
12. The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.
13. Shame is a soul eating emotion.
14. The rational attitude which permits us to declare objective values as valid at all is not the work of the individual subject, but the product of human history.
15. Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent.” – Carl Jung
16. The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.
17. To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem.
18. To me dreams are part of nature, which harbors no intention to deceive but expresses something as best it can.
19. The capacity for directed thinking I call intellect; the capacity for passive or undirected thinking I call intellectual intuition.
20. Sometimes, indeed, there is such a discrepancy between the genius and his human qualities that one has to ask oneself whether a little less talent might not have been better.
21. I have always been impressed by the fact that there are a surprising number of individuals who never use their minds if they can avoid it, and an equal number who do use their minds, but in an amazingly stupid way.
22. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to a better understanding of ourselves.
23. Creative powers can just as easily turn out to be destructive. It rests solely with the moral personality.
24. Whether they apply themselves to good things or to bad. And if this is lacking, no teacher can supply it or take its place.
25. That which compels us to create a substitute for ourselves is not the external lack of objects, but our incapacity to lovingly include a thing outside of ourselves.
26. A dream that is not understood remains a mere occurrence; understood it becomes a living experience.
27. A special ability means a heavy expenditure of energy in a particular direction, with a consequent drain from some other side of life.
28. We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much by feeling. Therefore, the judgment of the intellect is, at best, only the half of truth, and must, if it be honest, also come to an understanding of its inadequacy.
29. If a man knows more than others, he becomes lonely.
30. I regret many follies which sprang from my obstinacy; but without that trait I would not have reached my goal.
31. “As any change must begin somewhere, it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through. The change must indeed begin with an individual; it might be any one of us. Nobody can afford to look round and to wait for somebody else to do what he is loath to do himself.
32. When we consider the infinite variety of dreams, it is difficult to conceive that there could ever be a method or a technical procedure which would lead to an infallible result. It is, indeed, a good thing that no valid method exists for otherwise the meaning of the dream would be limited in advance and would lose precisely that virtue which makes dreams so valuable for therapeutic purposes – their ability to offer new points of view.
33. The greatest and most important problems of life are all fundamentally insoluble. They can never be solved but only outgrown.
34. A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them.
35. Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
36. I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.
37. The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it.
38. It is often tragic to see how blatantly a man bungles his own life and the lives of others yet remains totally incapable of seeing how much the whole tragedy originates in himself, and how he continually feeds it and keeps it going.
39. I shall not commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.
40. Resistance to the organized mass can be effected only by the man who is as well organized in his individuality as the mass itself.
41. The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases.
42. Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.
43. The acceptance of oneself is the essence of the whole moral problem and the epitome of a whole outlook on life.
44. We cannot change anything unless we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.
45. Find out what a person fears most and that is where he will develop next.
46. The pendulum of the mind oscillates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.
47. No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.
48. Where wisdom reigns, there is no conflict between thinking and feeling.
49. Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health.
50. There are as many nights as days, and the one is just as long as the other in the year’s course. Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word ‘happy’ would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.
51. Nobody can fall so low unless he has a great depth.
52. If such a thing can happen to a man, it challenges his best and highest on the other side; that is to say, this depth corresponds to a potential height, and the blackest darkness to a hidden light.
53. In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.
54. Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble.
55. Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.
56. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.
57. Faith, hope, love, and insight are the highest achievements of human effort. They are found-given-by experience.

He is known for his 1818 work *[The World as Will and Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation)* (expanded in 1844), which characterizes the [phenomenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) world as the manifestation of a blind and irrational [noumenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon) will.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-10)[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-11)[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-12) Building on the [transcendental idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_idealism) of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) (1724–1804), Schopenhauer developed an [atheistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheistic) metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism).[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-WWR3-7)[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-Jacquette-8)

Schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in [Western philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy) to share and affirm significant tenets of [Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy), such as [asceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism), denial of the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(philosophy)), and the notion of the [world-as-appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)).[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-13) His work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of [philosophical pessimism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_pessimism).[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-14) Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, he had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schopenhauer's_aesthetics), [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality), and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) have influenced many thinkers and artists.
叔本华是[西方哲学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy)中最早分享和肯定[印度哲学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_philosophy)重要原则的思想家之一，例如[禁欲主义](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism)、[自我](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(philosophy))否定和[世界表象](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion))的概念。 [[ 13 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-13) 他的作品被描述为 [哲学悲观主义](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_pessimism)的典范。 [[ 14 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#cite_note-14) 尽管他的作品在生前未能引起广泛关注，但他死后对各个学科产生了影响，包括哲学、文学和科学。他关于 [美学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schopenhauer's_aesthetics)、[道德](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality)和[心理学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology)的著作影响了许多思想家和艺术家。

He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.
弗洛伊德的父母是[加利西亚犹太人，](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_Jews)出生于[奥地利帝国](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire)的[摩拉维亚](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia)小镇[弗赖贝格](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Příbor)。 1881 年，他在[维也纳大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna)获得医学博士学位。 [[ 5 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-5) [[ 6 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-6) 1885 年完成 [训练](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation)后，他被任命为[神经病理学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropathology)[讲师](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docent)，并于 1902 年成为附属教授。 [[ 7 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-7) 弗洛伊德在 [维也纳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna)生活和工作，并于 1886 年在那里建立了他的临床实践[。](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss) 1938 年 3 月[奥地利吞并后](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss)，弗洛伊德离开奥地利以躲避[纳粹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi)迫害。 1939 年他在英国流亡途中去世。

In founding [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis), Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of [free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(psychology)) and discovered [transference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference), establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the [Oedipus complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex) as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-8) His analysis of [dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream) as wish-fulfilments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of [repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology)). On this basis, Freud elaborated his theory of the [unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#The_unconscious) and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising [id, ego and super-ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego).[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-mannoni-9) Freud postulated the existence of [libido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido), sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a [death drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive), the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression, and [neurotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis) guilt.[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-mannoni-9) In his later work, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.
在创立[精神分析](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis)时，弗洛伊德发展了使用[自由联想](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(psychology))等治疗技术，并发现了[移情](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference)，确立了其在分析过程中的核心作用。弗洛伊德对性的重新定义包括其婴儿形式，这导致他将[俄狄浦斯情结](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex)阐述为精神分析理论的中心原则。 [[ 8 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-8) 他将 [梦](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream)作为愿望实现的分析为他提供了临床分析症状形成和潜在的[压抑](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology))机制的模型。在此基础上，弗洛伊德阐述了他的[无意识](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#The_unconscious)理论，并进一步发展了由[本我、自我和超我](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego)组成的心理结构模型。 [[ 9 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-mannoni-9) 弗洛伊德假设存在 [力比多](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido)，即性能量，心理过程和结构投入其中并产生色情依恋，以及[死亡驱力](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive)，这是强迫性重复、仇恨、攻击性和[神经质](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis)内疚的根源。 [[ 9 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-mannoni-9) 在他后来的著作中，弗洛伊德对宗教和文化进行了广泛的解释和批判。

Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry), [psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy), and across the [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities). It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate concerning its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or hinders the [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist) cause.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-10) Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary [Western thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_thought) and popular culture. [W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)'s 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created "a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives".[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-11)
尽管作为一种诊断和临床实践，精神分析在总体上正在衰落，但它在[心理学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology)、[精神病学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry)、[心理治疗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy)和整个[人文学科](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities)中仍然具有影响力。因此，它继续引发关于其治疗功效、科学地位以及它是否促进或阻碍[女权主义](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist)事业的广泛且激烈的争论。 [[ 10 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-10) 尽管如此，弗洛伊德的著作已经渗透到当代 [西方思想](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_thought)和流行文化中。 [W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)'s 1940 年向弗洛伊德致敬的诗歌称他创造了 “一种整体的舆论氛围 / 我们在这种氛围下过着不同的生活”。 [[ 11 \]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud#cite_note-11)
