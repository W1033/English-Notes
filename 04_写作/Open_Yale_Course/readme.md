## Philosophy: Death

**Open Yale Course – Philosophy: Death**

**Transcript:**

All right, so this is Philosophy 176. The class is on death. My name is Shelley Kagan and the very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Shelly. That is, you know, if we meet on the street, come talk to me during office hours, you ask some question. Shel's the name that I respond to. I will eventually respond to Professor Kagan, but the synapses take a bit longer for that. It's not the name I immediately recognize. I have found that over the years fewer and fewer students feel comfortable calling me Shel. When I was young, it seemed to work. Now I'm gray and AUST, but as any Shel if you're comfortable with it, it's the name that I prefer to be called by.
好吧，这是哲学 176。这门课是关于死亡的。我的名字是雪莱·卡根，我想做的第一件事就是邀请您叫我雪莉。也就是说，你知道，如果我们在街上见面，在办公时间来找我聊天，你会问一些问题。谢尔是我回应的名字。我最终会回复卡根教授，但突触需要更长的时间。这不是我立即认出的名字。我发现这些年来越来越少的学生愿意叫我谢尔。当我年轻的时候，这似乎有效。现在我是灰色的，是澳大利亚人，但就像任何谢尔人一样，如果你觉得舒服的话，这是我更喜欢被称呼的名字。

Now, as I say, this is a class on death, but it's a philosophy class. And what that means is that the set of topics that we're going to be talking about in this class are not identical to the topics that other classes on death might try to cover. So, the first thing I want to do is say something about the things we won't be talking about that you might reasonably expect or hope that a class on death would talk about, so that if this is not the class you were looking for, you still have time to go check out some other class.
现在，正如我所说，这是一门关于死亡的课，但它也是一门哲学课。这意味着我们将在本课程中讨论的主题集与其他死亡课程可能试图涵盖的主题并不相同。所以，我想做的第一件事就是谈谈我们不会谈论的事情，你可能合理地期望或希望死亡课程会谈论这些事情，这样，如果这不是你正在寻找的课程，你还有时间去看看其他的课程。

So here are some things that a class on death could cover that we won't talk about. What I primarily have in mind are psychological and sociological questions about the nature of death or the phenomenon of death. So, a class on death might well have a discussion of the process of dying and coming to reconcile yourself with the fact that you're going to die. Some of you may know about Elizabeth Kübler-Ross's discussion of the so-called five stages of dying: there's denial, and then there's anger, and then there's bargaining. I'd actually remember the five stages we're not going to talk about that.
因此，这里有一些关于死亡的课程可以涵盖但我们不会讨论的内容。我主要想到的是关于死亡本质或死亡现象的心理学和社会学问题。因此，关于死亡的课程很可能会讨论死亡的过程，并让自己接受自己即将死亡的事实。你们中的一些人可能知道伊丽莎白·库伯勒-罗斯关于所谓死亡的五个阶段的讨论：先是否认，然后是愤怒，然后是讨价还价。我实际上记得五个阶段，我们不会谈论这个。

Similarly, we're not going to talk about the funeral industry in America and how it rips off people, which it does, rips off people in their moments of grief and weakness and overcharges them for the various things that it offers. We're not going to talk about that. We're not going to talk about the process of grieving or bereavement. We're not going to talk about sociological attitudes that we have towards the dying in our culture and how we tend to try to keep the dying hidden from the rest of us. These are all perfectly important topics, but they're not, as I say, topics that we're going to be talking about in this class.
同样，我们不会谈论美国的殡葬业以及它如何欺骗人们，它确实在人们悲伤和虚弱的时刻欺骗了他们，并对他们提供的各种东西收取了过高的费用。我们不会谈论这个。我们不会谈论悲伤或丧亲的过程。我们不会谈论我们文化中对死亡的社会学态度，以及我们如何试图对我们其他人隐藏死亡。这些都是非常重要的主题，但正如我所说，它们不是我们在这堂课上讨论的主题。

So, what will we talk about? Well, the things we'll talk about are philosophical questions that arise as we begin to think about the nature of death. Here's in broad scope, half the class is going to be—the first half of the class is going to be metaphysics. For those of you who are familiar with the philosophical piece of jargon, roughly half the class, the second half of the class, is going to be value theory. So, the first half of the class is going to be concerned with questions about the nature of death: what happens when we die? Indeed, to get at that question, the first thing we're going to have to think about is what are we? What kind of an entity is a person, particularly? Do we have souls? And for this class, when I talk about a soul, what I'm going to mean is sort of a bit of philosophical jargon as I'm going to mean something immaterial, something distinct from our bodies. Do we have immaterial souls, something that might survive the death of our body? And if not, what does that imply about the nature of death? What kind of an event is death? What is it for me to survive? What would it be for me to survive my death? What does it mean for me to survive tonight? That is, you know, somebody's going to be here lecturing to the class on Thursday. Presumably, that will be me. What is it for that person who's there on Thursday to be the same person as the person who's sitting here lecturing to you today? These are questions about the nature of personal identity. Pretty clearly, to think about death and continued existence and survival, we have to get clear about the nature of personal identity.
那么，我们将讨论什么呢？好吧，我们要讨论的是当我们开始思考死亡本质时出现的哲学问题。从广义上讲，一半的课程将是——前半部分课程将是形而上学。对于那些熟悉哲学术语的人来说，大约一半的课程，即课程的后半部分，将是价值理论。因此，课程的前半部分将关注有关死亡本质的问题：我们死后会发生什么？事实上，要回答这个问题，我们首先要思考的是我们是什么？特别是，人是一个什么样的实体？我们有灵魂吗？在这门课中，当我谈论灵魂时，我要指的是一些哲学术语，因为我要指的是一些非物质的东西，一些不同于我们身体的东西。我们是否有非物质的灵魂，在我们的身体死亡后仍然存在？如果不是，这对死亡的本质意味着什么？死亡是一个什么样的事件？我到底靠什么活下去？如果我能活下来，我会怎样？今晚活下来对我来说意味着什么？也就是说，你知道，星期四有人会在这里给同学们讲课。想必，那个人就是我。周四在场的那个人和今天坐在这里给你讲课的那个人是同一个人，这是什么意思？这些是关于个人身份本质的问题。很明显，要思考死亡以及继续存在和生存，我们必须弄清楚个人身份的本质。

These sorts of questions will occupy us for roughly the first half of the semester, and then we'll turn to value questions. If death is the end, is death bad? Now, of course, most of us are immediately and strongly inclined to think that death is bad, but there are a set of philosophical puzzles about how death could be bad. So, to give you a quick taste: if after my death I won't exist, how could anything be bad for me? How could anything be bad for something that doesn't exist? So how could death be bad? So, it's not that the result is going to be I'm going to try to convince you that death isn't bad, but it takes actually a little bit of work to pin down precisely what is it about death that's bad, and how can it be death, and is there more than one thing about death that makes it bad? We'll turn to questions like that.
这类问题将占据我们大约上半学期的时间，然后我们将转向价值问题。如果死亡是终结，那么死亡是坏事吗？当然，现在我们大多数人立即强烈地倾向于认为死亡是坏事，但关于死亡如何可能是坏事，存在一系列哲学难题。那么，让你快速体验一下：如果我死后我不再存在，怎么可能有什么事情对我有害呢？对于不存在的东西怎么可能有坏处呢？那么死亡怎么可能是坏事呢？所以，结果并不是我要试图让你相信死亡并不坏，而是实际上需要做一些工作才能准确地确定死亡的坏处是什么，以及如何坏。难道这就是死亡吗？关于死亡，是否有不止一件事让它变得糟糕？我们将转向类似的问题。

If death is bad, then one might wonder, would immortality be a good thing? And that's a question that we'll think about. Or more generally, we'll worry about how should the fact that I'm going to die affect the way I live? What should my attitude be towards my mortality? Should I be afraid of death, for example? Should I despair at the fact that I'm going to die?
如果死亡是坏事，那么人们可能会想，永生是一件好事吗？这是我们会思考的问题。或者更一般地说，我们会担心我即将死去的事实会如何影响我的生活方式？我应该对死亡采取什么态度？例如，我应该害怕死亡吗？我应该对自己即将死去的事实感到绝望吗？

Finally, we'll turn to questions about suicide. Many of us think that given the valuable, precious thing that life is, suicide makes no sense. You're throwing away the only life you're ever going to have. And so, we'll end the semester by thinking about questions along the lines of the rationality and morality of suicide. So, roughly speaking, that's where we're going. First half of the class: metaphysics. Second half of the class: value theory.
最后，我们将转向有关自杀的问题。我们许多人认为，考虑到生命的宝贵、珍贵，自杀毫无意义。你正在抛弃你唯一的生命。因此，我们将通过思考自杀的合理性和道德性问题来结束本学期。所以，粗略地说，这就是我们要去的地方。上半堂课：形而上学。课程后半部分：价值论。

Next thing I need to explain is this. There are roughly speaking two ways to do a class, especially an introductory class like this. In approach number one, you simply lay out the various positions, pro and con, and the professor strives to remain neutral, sort of not tip his hand about what he holds. That's sort of approach number one, and sometimes in my intro classes, that's the approach that I take. But the other approach, and the one that I should warn you I'm going to take this semester in this class, is rather different. There's a line that I'm going to be developing, pushing if you will, or defending in this class. That is to say, there's a certain set of views I hold about the issues that we'll be discussing, and what I'm going to try to do in this class is argue for those views, try to convince you that those views are correct. To help you know sort of ahead of time quickly what those views are, I want to start by describing a set of views that many of you probably believe. So, I'm going to give you a cluster of views. Logically speaking, you could believe some of these things and not all of them, but here's a set of views that many of you probably believe, and I imagine most of you believe at least some of these things.
接下来我需要解释的是这一点。上课的方式大致有两种，尤其是像这样的入门课。在第一种方法中，你只需列出各种立场，无论是赞成还是反对，教授都会努力保持中立，不会对他所持有的观点提出异议。这是第一种方法，有时在我的入门课程中，这就是我采取的方法。但另一种方法，也就是我应该警告你的方法，我将在本学期的这门课程中采用的方法，是相当不同的。我将在这堂课上发展一条路线，如果你愿意的话，可以推动它，或者捍卫它。也就是说，我对我们将要讨论的问题持有一定的观点，而我在这堂课上要做的就是为这些观点辩护，试图让你们相信这些观点是正确的。正确的。为了帮助您提前快速了解这些观点是什么，我想首先描述你们中许多人可能相信的一组观点。因此，我将向您提供一系列观点。从逻辑上讲，你可以相信其中一些事情，而不是全部，但这里有一组你们中的许多人可能相信的观点，我想你们中的大多数人至少相信其中的一些事情。

So, here's the set of common views. First of all, that we have a soul. That is to say, we are not just bodies. We're not just lumps of bone and flesh, but there's a part of us, perhaps the essential part of us, that is something more than the physical, the spiritual, immaterial part of us, which as I say in this class we'll call a soul. So, most of us, most of you probably believe in a soul. Certainly, most people in America believe in some sort of immaterial soul. And given the existence of this immaterial soul, it's a possibility, indeed a fair likelihood, that we will survive our deaths. Death will be the destruction of my body, but my soul is immaterial, and so my soul can continue to exist after my death. And whether or not you actually believe in a soul, you hope that there's a soul so that there'll be this serious possibility of surviving your death. Because death is not only bad but so horrible that what we would like to have happen is we would like to live forever. And so, armed with a soul, as it were, there's at least the possibility of immortality. Immortality would be wonderful. That's what we hope is the case. Whether or not we know that it's the case, immortality would be wonderful. That's why death's so bad. It robs us of immortality. And if there is no soul, if death is the end, if there is no immortality, this is such an overwhelmingly bad thing that the only obvious reaction, the natural reaction, the universal reaction, is to face the prospect of death with fear and despair. And as I mentioned earlier, death is so horrible, and life is so wonderful that it could never make sense to throw it away, and so suicide is both immoral on the one hand and never makes sense; it's always irrational as well.
所以，这是一组常见的观点。首先，我们有灵魂。也就是说，我们不仅仅是身体。我们不仅仅是骨头和肉块，而是我们的一部分，也许是我们的本质部分，这不仅仅是我们的身体、精神、非物质部分，正如我在这堂课上所说的那样，我们“会召唤一个灵魂。所以，我们大多数人，你们大多数人可能相信有灵魂。当然，大多数美国人相信某种非物质的灵魂。鉴于这个非物质灵魂的存在，我们有可能，甚至是相当可能，在死亡后幸存下来。死亡是我身体的毁灭，但我的灵魂是非物质的，所以我死后我的灵魂仍然可以继续存在。无论你是否真的相信灵魂存在，你都希望有一个灵魂，这样你死后就有很大的可能幸存下来。因为死亡不仅是坏事，而且是如此可怕，以至于我们希望发生的事情是我们希望永远活着。因此，可以说，有了灵魂，至少就有永生的可能。不朽将会是美妙的。我们希望情况如此。无论我们是否知道事实如此，永生都是美好的。这就是为什么死亡如此糟糕。它剥夺了我们的永生。如果没有灵魂，如果死亡就是终结，如果没有永生，这就是一件极其糟糕的事情，唯一明显的反应，自然的反应，普遍的反应，就是带着恐惧和恐惧面对死亡的前景。绝望。正如我之前提到的，死亡是那么可怕，而生命又是那么美妙，抛弃它是没有意义的，所以自杀一方面是不道德的，也是没有意义的；另一方面，自杀也是不道德的。它也总是不合理的。

In addition, all right, that, as I say, is I think a common set of views about the nature of death. And what I'm going to be doing, what I'm going to be arguing in this class, is that that set of views is pretty much mistaken from beginning to end. And so, I'm going to try to convince you that, you know, there is no soul. Immortality would not be a good thing. Fear of death isn't actually an appropriate response
另外，正如我所说，这是我认为关于死亡本质的一套共同观点。我将要做的，我将在这堂课上争论的是，这套观点从头到尾几乎都是错误的。所以，我将试图让你相信，你知道，没有灵魂。长生不老也不是什么好事。对死亡的恐惧实际上并不是一个适当的反应

to death. Suicide, under certain circumstances, might be rationally morally justified. As I say, the common picture is pretty much mistaken from start to end. That's at least my goal. That's my aim. That's what I'm going to be doing. Now, since of course, I believe the views I believe in, I hope at the end of the semester you'll agree with me because I think they're true, and I hope you'll end up believing the truth. But I should say that the crucial point isn't for you to agree with me. The crucial point is for you to think for yourself. And so, what I'm really doing is inviting you to take a good, cold, hard look at death and to face it and think about it in a way that most of us don't do.
至死。在某些情况下，自杀在道德上可能是合理的。正如我所说，人们的普遍看法从头到尾几乎都是错误的。这至少是我的目标。这就是我的目标。这就是我要做的事情。现在，当然，我相信我所相信的观点，我希望在学期结束时你会同意我的观点，因为我认为它们是正确的，我希望你最终会相信真理。但我要说的是，关键不在于你是否同意我的观点。关键是你要自己思考。所以，我真正要做的就是邀请你以一种我们大多数人不做的方式来认真、冷酷、严肃地看待死亡，面对它并思考它。

If you, at the end of the semester, haven't agreed with me about this particular claim or that particular claim, so be it. I'll be content. I won't be completely content, but I'll be at least largely content as long as you've really thought through the arguments on each side of these various issues. Car, maybe this would be a good time to pass around the syllabus.
如果你在学期末还没有同意我关于这个或那个特定主张的观点，那就这样吧。我就心满意足了我不会完全满意，但只要你真正思考了这些不同问题双方的论点，我至少会感到满意。汽车，也许现在是传递教学大纲的好时机。

All right, next introductory remark. A lot of today's talk is going to be devoted to business. I'll get to, if time permits, some philosophy at the end. I want to make you one more remark about what I'll be doing in terms of this class. This class, as I say, is a philosophy class. We'll basically be sitting here thinking about what we can know or make sense of with regard to death using our reasoning capacities. We'll be trying to think about death from a rational standpoint. One kind of evidence or one kind of argument that we won't be making use of here is an appeal to religious authority. So, some of you may believe in, for example, the existence of an afterlife. You may believe you're going to survive your death. You may believe in immortality because that's what your church teaches you, and that's fine. It's not my purpose or intention here to try to argue you out of your religious beliefs or to argue against your religious beliefs. All I'm going to ask is that we not appeal to such religious arguments, appeal to revelation or the authority of the Bible or what have you in the course of this argument, the course of this class. If you want to, you could think of this class as one big hypothetical: what conclusions would we come to about the nature of death if we had to think about it from a secular perspective, making use of only our own reasoning as opposed to whatever answers we might be given by divine revealed authority? Those of you who believe in divine revealed authority, you know, that's a debate for another day. It's not a debate that we're going to be engaged in here in this semester. And similarly, although I'm not going to ask you in your discussion sections to hide your religious views, you'll be asked, you know, in the course of defending them to give reasons that would make sense to all of us.
好吧，接下来是介绍性发言。今天的很多谈话将专门讨论商业。如果时间允许，我会在最后讲一些哲学。我想再向您说明一下我将在这门课上做什么。正如我所说，这堂课是一堂哲学课。我们基本上会坐在这里思考利用我们的推理能力我们可以知道或理解关于死亡的什么。我们将尝试从理性的角度思考死亡。我们在这里不会使用的一种证据或一种论据是诉诸宗教权威。例如，你们中的一些人可能相信来世的存在。你可能相信你会在死亡中幸存下来。你可能相信永生，因为那是你的教会教导你的，那很好。我在这里的目的或意图并不是试图说服你放弃你的宗教信仰或反对你的宗教信仰。我要问的是，我们不要诉诸这样的宗教论点，诉诸启示或圣经的权威，或者你在这个论点、这堂课的过程中所得到的东西。如果你愿意的话，你可以将这一类视为一个大假设：如果我们必须从世俗的角度思考死亡的本质，仅利用我们自己的推理而不是任何其他东西，我们会对死亡的本质得出什么结论神圣启示的权威可以给我们答案吗？你们中那些相信神圣启示权威的人，你们知道，这是另一天的辩论。这不是我们本学期要在这里进行的辩论。 同样，虽然我不会要求您在讨论部分隐藏您的宗教观点，但您知道，在捍卫这些观点的过程中，您会被要求给出对我们所有人都有意义的理由。

All right, that's by way of sort of where the class is going. Let me now turn to some discussion about the requirements of the class, grades, and so forth. The syllabus is going around the class. Almost all of you have it at this point. The syllabus doesn't really say a whole lot. I've already given you an overview of what topics we'll be going to. The crucial point about the syllabus is that it indicates what reading you need to have done for any given week. Now, I've done my best to peg the readings to where I will be on that week's lectures, but I don't lecture with lecture notes for the most part. Sometimes I take a little bit longer than I anticipated. Actually, I often take a little bit longer than I anticipated. No doubt at some point I'll fall behind; at some point, I may rush to catch up ahead. It won't always be the case that the readings will exactly coincide with where the lectures are at. Nonetheless, in any given week, for the start of that week, you should have done the readings that are listed for that week. The readings on the syllabus simply say the author, you know, and there's a couple of books that are available at the bookstore. There is a larger packet of readings that's available as a course pack at Taos. And so, for any given week, you know, you can find the reading. In one or two cases, maybe just one actually, where I've got more than one article by the given author, I've given the title of the article as well. It shouldn't be difficult to locate the reading for any given week. The format of the class, of course, is a familiar and straightforward one. I'll be sitting here lecturing twice a week at this time, 10:30 to 11:20. Once a week, you will break up into discussion sections. The discussion sections will meet for 50 minutes. You, of course, will have a single time. Each one of you will have a single time. There will be different times the discussion sections meet. For the first time, the philosophy department has just switched over to the online discussion section registration system. I'm not 100% certain how that works. I've not used it before. I take it the idea is something like this: right now, if you were to shop the class, you could find the tentative list of discussion section days and times. So, be sure to find some time that works for you. You can't actually register for any of those discussion section times yet, but as of, I think, next week when you're able to begin your online registration, you will be able to register for any discussion section that still has a slot, still has a space open in it. In fact, you won't be able to finalize your registration for your courses until you've actually signed up for an available slot. Once you have registered, if some other slots become available that weren't previously available, I gather you'll be sent some sort of email by the system. In case some other time would be better for you, you can put yourself on waiting lists and so forth. It sounds pretty good on paper. Maybe it'll all work smoothly. I've never been through it before. I hope we won't have any problems, but right now what you want to make sure is that there is a time that's available. I mean, right now all the times are available, but that there is a time that works for you. Because if you can't find a discussion section that works for you, you won't be able to take this course. Any questions about that? Any questions? I should actually ask, any questions about anything that I've asked or said so far up to this point?
好吧，这就是课程的走向。现在我来讨论一下班级的要求、成绩等等。教学大纲正在全班进行。此时，几乎所有人都拥有了它。教学大纲并没有说太多。我已经向您概述了我们将讨论的主题。教学大纲的关键点在于，它表明了您在任何给定的一周内需要完成哪些阅读。现在，我已尽力将阅读内容与我将在该周的讲座中的内容挂钩，但我在大多数情况下不会使用讲义进行授课。有时我花的时间比我预期的要长一些。事实上，我经常比我预期的要花更长的时间。毫无疑问，在某些时候我会落后；在某个时刻，我可能会急于赶上。阅读材料并不总是与讲座内容完全一致。尽管如此，在任何给定的一周中，在该周开始时，您都应该完成该周列出的阅读内容。教学大纲上的阅读材料只是简单地说明了作者，你知道，书店里有几本书可以买到。在陶斯有一个更大的读物包作为课程包提供。因此，在任何特定的一周，你都可以找到阅读内容。在一两种情况下，实际上可能只是一种情况，当我收到给定作者的多篇文章时，我也会给出该文章的标题。找到任意一周的读数应该不难。当然，课程的形式是一种熟悉且简单的形式。我每周都会坐在这里讲课两次，时间是 10:30 到 11:20。每周一次，您将分成讨论部分。讨论部分将持续 50 分钟。 当然，你会有一次。你们每个人都会有一次。讨论部分的开会时间会有所不同。哲学系刚刚第一次切换到在线讨论区注册系统。我不是 100% 确定它是如何工作的。我以前没用过它。我认为这个想法是这样的：现在，如果你要浏览课程，你可以找到讨论部分日期和时间的暂定列表。因此，一定要找到适合您的时间。您实际上还不能注册任何讨论部分的时间，但我认为，下周当您能够开始在线注册时，您将能够注册仍然有空位的任何讨论部分，其中仍然有一个空位。事实上，在您实际注册可用空位之前，您将无法完成课程注册。注册后，如果以前不可用的其他插槽可用，我猜系统会向您发送某种电子邮件。如果其他时间对您来说更好，您可以将自己列入等候名单等。纸面上听起来不错。也许一切都会顺利。我以前从未经历过。我希望我们不会有任何问题，但现在你要确定的是有空的时间。我的意思是，现在所有的时间都可以，但总有一个时间适合你。因为如果您找不到适合您的讨论部分，您将无法学习本课程。对此有什么疑问吗？任何问题？我实际上应该问，到目前为止我所问或所说的任何事情有什么问题吗？

Let me make a remark about questions, which is: today's mostly business; hopefully it'll be fairly straightforward. But both today and throughout the entire semester, as I'm lecturing, I want to invite you to jump in with questions. Well, jump in is a bit of an exaggeration. I don't want you to just start talking, but, you know, raise your hand. You know, if I'm saying something that you don't understand, the chances are pretty good that there's 25 or 50 other students in the class who don't understand it either. I'm just not being clear, and so I want to welcome you. I really want to invite you whenever you've got some reactions to the things that I'm saying. You know, Shelly, raise your hand. I'll call on you. Say, Shel, I didn't really understand what you were saying about the soul. Could you please explain that again? Or, for that matter, if you've got some quick reactions or thoughts or responses to the arguments that I'm laying out and you want to share them with the class as a whole, then very much I want to invite you to do this.
我就问题说一下，就是：今天主要是生意；希望这会相当简单。但在今天和整个学期，当我演讲时，我想邀请你们提出问题。嗯，跳进去有点夸张。我不希望你开始说话，但是，你知道，请举手。你知道，如果我说的话你听不懂，班上很可能有 25 或 50 名其他学生也听不懂。我只是不太清楚，所以我想欢迎你。每当你对我所说的事情有一些反应时，我真的很想邀请你。你知道，雪莉，举手。我会打电话给你。谢尔，我真的不明白你所说的关于灵魂的内容。您能再解释一下吗？或者，就此而言，如果您对我提出的论点有一些快速的反应或想法或回应，并且您想与全班分享它们，那么我非常想邀请您这样做这。

Now, this class is too big for us to have some, you know, close, intimate conversation between the 150, 180, however many students there are here. That's not going to happen. But, you know, there's a chance for detailed discussion in the discussion section. I mean, that's where that should happen. But still, there is the chance for, you know, brief reactions and definitely a chance for questions, and I very much want to invite you to do that. So, if at any point you've got something you want to ask about or some two bits you want to add, raise your hand, wiggle it around, make sure I see you. I may want to finish the particular point that I'm making, but I'll try to come back to you and then, you know, raise your question. And if I remember, at least, I will repeat the question out loud so that everybody can hear it.
现在，这个班级太大了，我们无法在 150 名、180 名学生之间进行密切、亲密的交谈，无论这里有多少学生。那不会发生。但是，你知道，讨论部分有机会进行详细讨论。我的意思是，这就是应该发生的地方。但是，您知道，仍然有机会进行简短的反应，并且绝对有机会提出问题，我非常想邀请您这样做。因此，如果您在任何时候有什么问题想问，或者有两点想补充，请举手，晃动一下，确保我看到您。我可能想完成我正在提出的特定观点，但我会尽力回到您身边，然后提出您的问题。如果我记得的话，至少我会大声重复这个问题，以便每个人都能听到。

I also want to say that I will try to have the practice of, after class ends, if you want to continue the discussion, you have some questions that occurred to you towards the end, and we didn't have a chance to share them with the class as a whole, I will, on a normal day, meet outside and continue to talk with however many of you want to do that until you're done. I mean, I just love talking about this stuff, and, you know, so I welcome you to come to my office hours. I invite you to ask questions in class or if you prefer after class as well. Again, any questions about any of that? Yeah? When are your office hours? When are my office hours? That's a great question, and I don't know the answer to it. I haven't planned them yet. On Thursday, start the class by asking me that, and I'll give you an answer.
我还想说，我会尝试有这样的练习，下课后，如果你想继续讨论，你有一些到最后想到的问题，我们没有机会分享。对于整个班级来说，我会在正常的一天在外面见面并继续与你们中的许多人交谈，直到你们完成为止。我的意思是，我只是喜欢谈论这些东西，而且，你知道，所以我欢迎你来我的办公时间。我邀请您在课堂上提问，或者如果您愿意的话，也可以在课后提问。再说一次，对此有任何疑问吗？是的？你们的办公时间是什么时候？我的办公时间是什么时候？这是一个很好的问题，但我不知道答案。我还没有计划它们。周四，在上课时问我这个问题，我会给你答案。

All right, other bits of business. I should say something about grades. Now, many of you may have heard, many of you may know, and if you don't already know this, I should warn you that I have a reputation around Yale as being a harsh grader. I know this is true. That is, I know I have the reputation both because I periodically, in my student evaluations
好吧，其他的事情。我应该说一些关于成绩的事情。现在，你们中的许多人可能已经听说过，你们中的许多人可能知道，如果您还不知道这一点，我应该警告您，我在耶鲁大学享有严厉的评分者的声誉。我知道这是真的。也就是说，我知道我享有声誉，因为我定期在学生评估中

, get told I'm one of Yale's harsher graders, harder graders, and because every now and then the Yale Daily News will have an article about grade inflation, and they always ask me, well, you know, Professor Kagan is somebody—once there was a story on grade inflation that the Yale Daily News began by saying, "Shelly Kagan (known at Yale as one of the hardest graders)". So, I know I've got at least the reputation of being a hard grader. I don't actually know whether it's deserved or not because Yale does not publish information about what the grading averages are. At other schools I've taught at, there's been information along the lines of, well, the typical grade in an introductory course in the humanities is such and such. Shortly after I came here to Yale and I started realizing that people thought I was a harder grader than most other professors, I called the administration and asked, "Do you have this sort of information?" And the answer is yes. "Will you give it to me?" The answer was no. They don't share this information with the Yale faculty. It seems odd. The explanation, of course, actually isn't that hard to come by. The worry is that those of us who are harder graders than average, if the information were published, would feel guilty and sort of ease up on our grading, but those who are easier graders than average will never feel guilty and toughen up. And so, the result would be a constant push up with the grades. Anyway, so I don't know for a certainty that I'm a harder grader, but I believe that it's the case based on reactions I get when I give the speech that I'm about to give.
，被告知我是耶鲁大学最严厉的评分者之一，因为耶鲁每日新闻时不时会有一篇关于分数膨胀的文章，他们总是问我，嗯，你知道，卡根教授是一个伟大的人物——曾经《耶鲁每日新闻》有一篇关于成绩膨胀的报道，开头写道：“雪莉·卡根（在耶鲁大学被认为是最难的评分者之一）”。所以，我知道我至少享有“严格评分者”的声誉。我实际上不知道它是否值得，因为耶鲁大学没有发布有关平均分的信息。在我教过的其他学校，有一些信息是这样的，人文学科入门课程的典型成绩是这样那样的。我来到耶鲁大学后不久，我开始意识到人们认为我比大多数其他教授更难评分，我打电话给管理部门并询问：“你有这类信息吗？”答案是肯定的。 “你愿意给我吗？”答案是否定的。他们不会与耶鲁大学的教员分享这些信息。看起来很奇怪。当然，这个解释实际上并不难得到。令人担心的是，如果这些信息被公开，我们这些比平均水平更难评分的人会感到内疚，并在某种程度上放松我们的评分，但那些比平均水平更容易评分的人永远不会感到内疚和坚强。因此，结果将是成绩不断提高。无论如何，所以我不确定我是否是一个更难的评分者，但我相信根据我即将发表的演讲时得到的反应，情况确实如此。

Okay, so when I open the Blue Book, the Yale guideline, you know, the Yale catalog, it's got a page, as you all know, where it says what grades, what letter grades mean at Yale. I didn't actually bring it this year. Sometimes I do, but I've got it pretty much memorized. It says, for example, next to each letter grade, you know, what it means. B, for example, means good. A means excellent. C means satisfactory. D is passing. F is failing. B, let's start with B. B means good. Now, the crucial question then is, what does good mean? I take good to mean good. Consequently, if you were to write a good paper for me, that would get a B. And when you get a B from me—now I say me, this is the Royal me, you know, because I won't actually be grading your papers. Your papers will be graded by a small army of TAs, but they will grade under my supervision and in keeping with the standards that I ask them to grade with. So, when you're pissed off about your grades, the person to take it up with is, well, take it up with them, but, you know, eventually you want to take it up with me.
好吧，当我打开蓝皮书，耶鲁大学指南，你知道，耶鲁大学目录时，它有一页，正如你们所知，上面写着什么成绩，字母成绩在耶鲁意味着什么。其实今年我没带。有时我会这样做，但我已经记住了很多。例如，它在每个字母等级旁边写着，你知道，它意味着什么。例如，B 表示良好。 A的意思是优秀。 C表示满意。 D 正在通过。 F 失败了。 B，让我们从B开始。B意味着好。现在，关键问题是，“好”意味着什么？我认为“好”就是“好”的意思。因此，如果你要为我写一篇好论文，那就会得到 B。当你从我那里得到 B 时——现在我说我，这就是皇家我，你知道，因为我实际上不会评分你的论文。你的论文将由一小群助教进行评分，但他们将在我的监督下并按照我要求他们评分的标准进行评分。所以，当你对自己的成绩感到生气时，该向他们倾诉的人就是，好吧，向他们倾诉，但是，你知道，最终你想向我倾诉。

So, when you get a B from us, B doesn't mean, "What a piece of crap." B means, "Good job." And so, you should be pleased to get a B because it meant you were doing good work, and it's not easy to do good work in philosophy. A means excellent. Now, excellent does not mean publishable. Excellent does not mean you are God's gift to philosophy, right? And so, it's crucial to understand it doesn't mean that the only way you're going to get an A is to be God's gift to philosophy. A's mean excellent work for a first class in philosophy. This is an introductory class. It does not presuppose any background in philosophy. Still, to get an A, you've got to show some flair for the subject. You've got to show not only have you sort of understood the ideas that have been put forward in the readings and the lectures and so forth, but you see how to sort of put them together into a paper in a way that shows you've got some aptitude here. You did it in a way that made us take note. That's what we try to reserve A's for. Some of you will end up getting A's, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will end up getting B's, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will not start out doing good work. Many of you will start out doing satisfactory work or, truth be told, less than satisfactory work.
因此，当您从我们这里得到 B 时，B 并不意味着“真是一坨屎”。 B 的意思是“干得好”。所以，你应该很高兴得到 B，因为这意味着你做得很好，而在哲学领域做得很好并不容易。 A的意思是优秀。现在，优秀并不意味着可以发表。优秀并不意味着你是上帝赐予哲学的礼物，对吗？因此，重要的是要明白，这并不意味着你获得 A 的唯一方法就是成为上帝赐予哲学的礼物。 A 的意思是哲学一流的优秀作品。这是一门入门课程。它不预设任何哲学背景。不过，要获得 A，你必须在这门学科上表现出一定的天赋。你不仅要表现出你对阅读材料和讲座等中提出的想法有一定程度的理解，而且你要知道如何以一种向你展示的方式将它们组合成一篇论文。我在这里有一些才能。你这样做的方式引起了我们的注意。这就是我们尝试保留 A 的原因。你们中的一些人最终会在学期结束时获得A，即使不是在开始时。你们中的许多人最终都会在学期结束时获得B，即使不是在开始时。你们中的许多人不会一开始就做好工作。你们中的许多人一开始都会做令人满意的工作，或者说实话，工作不太令人满意。

Now look, I was an undergraduate once, and I know what it is to write a typical undergraduate paper. You sit down the night before, and you had a couple of ideas, you thought about it maybe for a half an hour, and you meant to get to it sooner, but you had a lot of other things to do. And you throw it off in a couple of hours, and, you know, maybe stay up late, and, you know, it's not the worst thing you ever wrote, and it's not the best thing you ever wrote, and it has a couple of nice ideas, but maybe it could be better. It's sort of a satisfactory job. Well, Yale says satisfactory means C, and so many of you will start off the semester writing that kind of paper. And the fact of the matter is, some of you will start off writing worse papers than that because writing a philosophy paper is a difficult thing to learn how to do. It's not—it's exercising a set of muscles that a lot of you have not spent a lot of time exercising. Now, it's not that you haven't spent any time doing it. I mean, you've had bull sessions, right, with your high school friends or in your college dorm or what have you, but you haven't done it with the kind of discipline and rigor that we're looking for here. And so, like anything else, it's a skill that gets better with practice. But what that means, of course, is you won't do as well at the beginning as you're likely to be doing toward the end. Some of you, unfortunately, won't do very good jobs at the beginning. And my TAs, I'll encourage them to be prepared to give D's if the vices of the paper significantly outweigh the virtues. That's a D. If the vices very significantly outweigh whatever virtues there are, that's some kind of an F. So, the fact of the matter is many of you, in your initial papers, will get lower grades than you've probably ever gotten before in your life.
现在看，我曾经是一名本科生，我知道写一篇典型的本科论文是什么。前一天晚上你坐下来，有几个想法，你可能考虑了半个小时，你打算早点开始，但你还有很多其他事情要做。你在几个小时内就把它扔掉了，而且，你知道，也许熬夜，而且，你知道，这不是你写过的最糟糕的东西，也不是你写过的最好的东西，而且它有几个不错的想法，但也许还可以更好。这真是一份令人满意的工作。嗯，耶鲁大学说满意意味着 C，所以你们中的很多人都会在学期开始时写这种论文。事实是，你们中的一些人一开始会写出比这更糟糕的论文，因为写哲学论文是一件很难学会如何去做的事情。它不是——它是在锻炼一组你们很多人都没有花很多时间锻炼的肌肉。现在，您并不是没有花时间去做这件事。我的意思是，你已经和你的高中朋友或在你的大学宿舍或其他什么地方进行了公牛会议，对吧，但你没有以我们在这里寻求的那种纪律和严谨来做到这一点。因此，就像其他任何事情一样，这是一项可以通过练习变得更好的技能。但这当然意味着你一开始的表现可能不会像最后那样好。不幸的是，你们中的一些人一开始不会做得很好。我的助教们，如果论文的缺点明显超过优点，我会鼓励他们准备好给 D。如果恶习明显超过了任何美德，那就是 F。 所以，事实是，你们中的许多人在最初的论文中，会得到比你一生中可能获得的更低的分数。

I wanted to warn you about that. Now, I say this not so much to depress the hell out of you, but partly to warn you, and B, to make it clear that I believe that it's a skill. Writing a good philosophy paper is a skill, and you can get better at it. And consequently, most of you will get better at it. And so, let me make the following remark. Look, officially, each paper—you have three five-page papers. Each paper is worth 25% of your grade, officially. But the remaining 25% is discussion section. I'll get to that in a minute. Officially, 25% of your grade for each of the three papers. But if, over the course of the semester, you get better, then we will give—at the end of the semester, when we're figuring out your semester grade—we will give the later, stronger papers more than their official weight. For many of you, the first paper will be clearly the worst paper you write, and then we'll just throw that grade away, give greater weight to the second and third paper. If the third paper is stronger still, we'll give even more weight to the third paper. There's no formula here. A great deal depends on the overall pattern, what your TA tells me about how you've done over the course of the semester. But this policy of giving greater weight if you show improvement is something that most of you will benefit from. And so, if you end up not doing well, the moral of the story is not to go running off and dropping the class, but to figure out what you did right, what you didn't do right, how to make the second paper better, and then the third paper stronger again. And if you do show improvement, that will very significantly influence and emerge in terms of the impact it has on your overall semester grade.
我想警告你这一点。现在，我说这些并不是为了让你感到沮丧，而是为了警告你和B，明确表示我相信这是一种技能。写一篇好的哲学论文是一项技能，你可以做得更好。因此，你们中的大多数人都会做得更好。因此，让我发表以下评论。正式地看每篇论文——你有三篇五页的论文。按照官方说法，每篇论文占你成绩的 25%。但剩下的25%是讨论部分。我稍后会讲到这一点。按照官方规定，三篇试卷各占你成绩的 25%。但是，如果在整个学期中，你的成绩有所提高，那么我们将在学期结束时，当我们计算出你的学期成绩时，给予较晚的、更强的论文超过其官方权重的分数。对于你们中的许多人来说，第一篇论文显然是你们写的最差的论文，然后我们就会放弃这个分数，给予第二篇和第三篇论文更大的权重。如果第三篇论文仍然更强，我们将给予第三篇论文更大的权重。这里没有公式。很大程度上取决于整体模式，你的助教告诉我你在整个学期的表现。但是，如果你表现出进步，就给予更大的权重，这种政策会让你们大多数人受益。所以，如果你最终表现不佳，这个故事的寓意不是逃跑并辍学，而是弄清楚你做对了什么，你做错了什么，如何写第二篇论文更好，然后第三篇论文又更强了。如果你确实表现出了进步，这将非常显着地影响你整个学期的成绩。

Because of this policy, I don't actually know when all is said and done whether, at the end of the semester, I'm any harder—you know, whether I depart from the average or not. Let me quickly mention here's a fairly typical grade distribution for the overall grades at the end of the semester. Roughly 25% of you are likely to end up with some kind of an A at the end of the semester. 50-55% of you or so are likely to end up with some kind of a B. 20-25% of you might end up with some sort of a C. Sometimes there's a couple of percent that end up worse than that. Unsurprisingly, you've got the ability to do decent work in this class, and most of you have the ability to do good work, and some of you have—a fair chunk of you have the ability to do excellent work, though it may take some work on your part to get to that point.
由于这项政策，我实际上不知道在学期结束时，我是否会更加努力——你知道，我是否偏离平均水平。让我快速提一下，这是学期结束时总体成绩的相当典型的成绩分布。大约 25% 的人可能会在学期结束时获得某种 A 的成绩。大约 50-55% 的人最终可能会得到某种 B。20-25% 的人可能最终会得到某种 C。有时，有几个百分比的人最终会得到比这更糟糕的结果。毫不奇怪，你们有能力在这个班级里做好工作，你们中的大多数人都有能力做好工作，你们中的一些人有——相当一部分人有能力做好工作，尽管这可能为了达到这一点，你需要做一些工作。

Last thing I should say about the grades is, look, why do I do this? Really, I try to do it as a sign of respect for you. I know that may seem like a surprising thing to say when I've just sort of gone on in my little gleeful manner about how I'm going to fail all of you. But, I mean, it's worth my saying, you know, you guys are so smart, you're so talented, you've gotten so far on your ability that many of you have learned to coast, and it's not doing you any kind of service to let you continue coasting. My goal here is to be honest with you, right? Say, look,
关于成绩我要说的最后一件事是，看，我为什么要这样做？真的，我尝试这样做是为了表达对你的尊重。我知道，当我以一种有点高兴的方式继续谈论我将如何让你们所有人失望时，这么说似乎是一件令人惊讶的事情。但是，我的意思是，值得我说的是，你们知道，你们是如此聪明，你们如此有才华，你们的能力已经达到了如此高的水平，以至于你们中的许多人已经学会了滑行，但这对你们没有任何好处的服务让您继续滑行。我的目标是对你诚实，对吗？说，看，

you're smart enough, probably most of you, to pull off some sort of B without a lot of—without breaking into a sweat, at least not a significant sweat. So be it. But it's just lying to you to pretend that that's excellence in philosophy. And so, what I want to do in this class is be honest with you and tell you, you've really done work here to be extraordinarily proud of yourself versus, yeah, you've done something okay. Or, look, you've done good work. Admittedly, it's not great, but you've done good work. Right?
你们（可能是你们中的大多数人）足够聪明，能够在不费力气的情况下完成某种 B 任务——不费吹灰之力，至少不是大量出汗。就这样吧。但如果你假装那是哲学上的卓越，那只是在骗你。因此，我在这堂课上想做的就是诚实地告诉你，你确实在这里做了工作，为自己感到非常自豪，而不是，是的，你做得还不错。或者，看，你做得很好。诚然，这不是很好，但你已经做得很好了。正确的？

That's 75% of your grade is the papers. The remaining 25% of your grade is based on discussion section. Now, that's a lot of your grade to turn on discussion section. And so, the first thing I need to tell you is, I really mean it: if you blow off discussion section, your grade will suffer. So, it's worth knowing in a general way what do you need to do to earn a good grade in discussion section. And here, the answer is perhaps the obvious one: you need to participate. You need to come to discussion sections having thought about the lectures, having done the readings, having thought about the questions that they raise, and you need to come to discussion section then prepared to discuss this week's set of issues. You need to listen to what your classmates are saying and say why you disagree with them, and not just that you disagree with them, but to raise an objection or why you agree with them. And when somebody else attacks them, say, look, I think that what John was saying was a good point, and here's how I think he should have defended his position, or what have you. You need to engage in philosophical discussion. If you're not participating in discussion section, you're not doing what the section is there for. Philosophers love to talk, and we love to argue. And the way to get better at thinking about philosophy is by talking about philosophy. And so, I'm putting my money where my mouth is. I'm saying, look, yeah, that's an important part of the class, so important that it's going to be worth 25% of your grade. Again, it doesn't mean—this is slightly different from the papers—it doesn't mean that you've got to be brilliant philosophically to get an A. Rather, you've got to be a wonderful class citizen to get an A for discussion sections. And so, as I put it, in fact, I think I put this way in the syllabus, sort of participation, and here I mean sort of, you know, respectful participation, not hogging the limelight, but your participation can improve your grade, but it won't lower your grade. Non-participation or not being there, that will lower your participation grade.
也就是说，你的成绩的 75% 是论文。其余 25% 的成绩基于讨论部分。现在，你的分数已经很高了，可以打开讨论部分了。所以，我需要告诉你的第一件事是，我是认真的：如果你取消讨论部分，你的成绩将会受到影响。因此，有必要大致了解一下您需要做什么才能在讨论部分获得好成绩。在这里，答案也许是显而易见的：你需要参与。你需要在进入讨论部分之前思考讲座、完成阅读、思考他们提出的问题，然后你需要进入讨论部分，然后准备讨论本周的一系列问题。你需要倾听你的同学在说什么，并说出你为什么不同意他们的观点，不仅仅是你不同意他们的观点，而是要提出反对意见或为什么你同意他们的观点。当其他人攻击他们时，比如说，看，我认为约翰所说的是一个很好的观点，这就是我认为他应该如何捍卫自己的立场，或者你有什么。你需要进行哲学讨论。如果您不参与讨论部分，那么您就没有做该部分的用途。哲学家喜欢说话，我们也喜欢争论。更好地思考哲学的方法就是谈论哲学。所以，我就说到做到。我是说，看，是的，这是课程的重要组成部分，非常重要，以至于它占你成绩的 25%。再说一遍，这并不意味着——这与论文中的略有不同——这并不意味着你必须在哲学上非常出色才能获得 A。相反，你必须成为一名出色的班级公民才能获得 A。 A 用于讨论部分。 所以，正如我所说的，事实上，我想我在教学大纲中是这样说的，有点参与，这里我的意思是，你知道，尊重的参与，不是抢风头，而是你的参与可以提高你的成绩，但不会降低你的成绩。不参与或不在场，这会降低你的参与等级。

Again, any questions about any of that? All right. So, you know, I'm sorry to have sort of the long gloom and doom, but it seems that it's only fair to sort of let you know what you're getting into. One other remark about the discussion sections: the way I think of it is like the conversation hour for your foreign language class. Many—how many of you have had a philosophy class before? Look, thanks, you know, maybe 15% of you, maybe 20% of you. Most of you have not, right? That's pretty normal, right? Don't go into discussion section thinking, "Oh, I can't talk. I don't have any background in philosophy. I've never done this sort of thing before." That's true for most of you. The way you get better is by talking philosophy.
再说一次，对此有任何疑问吗？好的。所以，你知道，我很抱歉让你经历了漫长的忧郁和厄运，但似乎让你知道你将面临什么才是公平的。关于讨论部分的另一句话：我认为它就像外语课上的对话时间。很多——你们中有多少人以前上过哲学课？听着，谢谢，你知道，也许是 15% 的人，也许是 20% 的人。你们大多数人都没有，对吧？这很正常，对吧？不要在进入讨论部分时想：“哦，我不能说话。我没有任何哲学背景。我以前从未做过这种事情。”对于你们大多数人来说都是如此。你变得更好的方法是谈论哲学。

All right, next remark. I guess this is sort of just one less connection with regard to grades. This is an intro philosophy class. The crucial point about intro is it means first class in philosophy. It doesn't presuppose any background in philosophy. It doesn't necessarily mean easy. Some of this material, for some of you, is going to be very, very difficult. And although the number of pages that you'll have to read are not—you know, there's not a lot, probably a typical week 50 pages, maybe less—for many of you, you've got to find it dense material. And although, you know, I don't really have the fantasy that many of you will read this stuff twice, if you had the time to do it, that would be a wonderful thing to do. Philosophy is hard stuff to read.
好，接下来说。我想这只是与成绩之间少了一种联系。这是哲学入门课。介绍的关键点在于它意味着哲学上的一流。它不预设任何哲学背景。这并不一定意味着容易。对于你们中的一些人来说，其中一些材料将会非常非常困难。虽然你需要阅读的页数不是——你知道，不是很多，通常一周可能需要 50 页，甚至更少——但对于你们中的许多人来说，你必须找到密集的材料。虽然，你知道，我并不幻想你们中的许多人会读两遍这些东西，但如果你们有时间这样做，那将是一件很棒的事情。哲学是很难读的东西。

Another remark about this being an intro class is that it's introductory in that the issues that we're talking about are kind of first run through. Every single thing that we discuss here could be pursued at greater depth. So, for example, we'll spend whatever it is, maybe a week and a half, talking about the nature of personal identity, two weeks. But one could easily spend an entire semester thinking about that question alone. So don't come away thinking that whatever it is that we've talked about here in lectures is the last word on the subject. Rather, it's something more like first words.
关于这是一门介绍性课程的另一个评论是，它是介绍性的，因为我们正在讨论的问题是首先讨论的。我们在这里讨论的每一件事都可以进行更深入的探讨。因此，举例来说，我们将花任何时间，也许一个半星期，谈论个人身份的本质，两周。但一个人很容易就花整个学期的时间来思考这个问题。因此，不要认为我们在讲座中讨论的内容就是该主题的最终结论。相反，它更像是第一句话。

Actually, one other word about the readings and the lectures: with one exception, I won't be spending very much time talking about the readings. The exception is Plato, where I'll spend a lecture, maybe two lectures, trying to reconstruct Plato's central arguments, at least the arguments as relevant to our class. We'll be reading one of Plato's dialogues. But for the most part, although I'll occasionally periodically refer to the readings, I won't spend a lot of time talking about the views in the readings. The readings you should think of as complementary to my lectures. The idea is that there's more to say than what I've said, and you'll find some more of what there is to say in the readings. Or there may be positions that I mention but I don't develop because I'm not perhaps sympathetic to them, and you might find somebody who is sympathetic to them developing them in the readings. The readings are a crucial component of the class. You won't get everything you need simply by coming to the lectures, but it's equally the case that the views that I'll be developing in the lectures, although not necessarily unique to me, aren't all laid out in the readings. You won't get everything I'm talking about in the lecture if all you do is the readings. They're both parts of the class.
实际上，关于阅读材料和讲座的另一句话是：除了一个例外，我不会花太多时间谈论阅读材料。柏拉图是个例外，我将用一个讲座，也许两个讲座，试图重建柏拉图的中心论点，至少是与我们课堂相关的论点。我们将阅读柏拉图的一篇对话录。但大多数情况下，虽然我偶尔会定期参考阅读材料，但我不会花很多时间谈论阅读材料中的观点。您应该将这些读物视为对我的讲座的补充。我的想法是，还有比我所说的更多的东西要说，并且您会在阅读材料中找到更多要说的内容。或者可能有一些我提到的立场，但我没有发展，因为我可能不同情他们，你可能会发现有人同情他们在阅读中发展它们。阅读材料是课堂的重要组成部分。仅仅通过听讲座你不会得到你需要的一切，但同样的情况是，我将在讲座中发展的观点虽然不一定是我独有的，但并不都在阅读材料中列出。如果你只做阅读，你就无法理解我在讲座中所说的一切。他们都是班级的一部分。

All right, I want to end by—not close to ending, but the last thing I'm going to do is read aloud some student evaluations. I have found over the years that some students like me, some students don't like me. I don't know how to make this point any clearer than to share with you a sampling of the student evaluations. These are not actually from last spring, but they're typical enough that I was too lazy to make some new quotes.
好吧，我想结束——还没有结束，但我要做的最后一件事就是大声朗读一些学生的评价。多年来我发现有些学生喜欢我，有些学生不喜欢我。我不知道如何比与您分享学生评估样本更清楚地阐明这一点。这些实际上不是去年春天的，但它们足够典型，我懒得做一些新的引用。

Quotes:

"The lectures were clear and followed a very logical order."
“讲座很清晰，并且遵循非常合乎逻辑的顺序。”

"I thought the class was not always organized."
“我认为课堂并不总是井井有条。”

"I thought it was a very well-organized class."
“我认为这是一堂组织得非常好的课程。”

"Overall, I was unsatisfied with this course. Few substantive conclusions were reached."
“总的来说，我对这门课程并不满意。没有得出什么实质性的结论。”

"Along the same vein, I think he should avoid saying at the end of each segment of the class, 'Ultimately, you'll have to decide what to think for yourself.' I should end the class by saying, 'You will believe.' Actually, I started the class by saying that. You will believe what I believe."
“同样，我认为他应该避免在课程的每个部分结束时说，‘最终，你必须决定自己想什么。’我应该在课程结束时说：“你会相信的。”事实上，我在上课时就是这么说的，你会相信我所相信的。”

"It might be improved by presenting other views better and more objectively since Kagan always ended a particular line of reasoning by defeating the argument if he didn't agree with it. He could be a bit more unbiased and tolerant of other perspectives."
“通过更好、更客观地提出其他观点可能会有所改善，因为如果卡根不同意某个观点，他总是通过击败论证来结束特定的推理。他可以更加公正和宽容地对待其他观点。”

"Lectures were sometimes repetitive or obvious, but occasionally they provided new insights."
“讲座有时是重复的或显而易见的，但有时它们会提供新的见解。”

"I know that some felt the pace of the arguments was a little slow, but I felt that this was generally necessary, not only for the unphilosophy-savvy population but also to cover all points."
“我知道有些人觉得争论的节奏有点慢，但我觉得这通常是必要的，不仅对于不懂哲学的人来说，而且对于涵盖所有要点。”

"Extremely thorough and thoughtful, receptive to questions, brilliant. I like that one."
“非常彻底和深思熟虑，乐于接受问题，太棒了。我喜欢那个。”

"Often long-winded."

"He does go around and around the same idea a number of times, which does cut down on the notes for the class, but it can get a little boring."
“他确实多次反复讨论同一个想法，这确实减少了课堂笔记，但可能会变得有点无聊。”

"Though I've heard students say he often repeats himself, I think this is a merit in a philosophy course in which arguments and thoughts can quickly become confusing."
“虽然我听学生说他经常重复自己的话，但我认为这是哲学课程的一个优点，在哲学课程中，论点和思想很快就会变得混乱。”

"Shelly Kagan is a fabulous, resourceful, utterly convincing lecturer."
“雪莉·卡根是一位出色、足智多谋、完全令人信服的讲师。”

"He would work through arguments right in front of us, which then helped me work through them on my own."
“他会在我们面前解决争论，然后帮助我自己解决这些问题。”

"Shelly is an incredibly dynamic lecturer."
“雪莉是一位非常充满活力的讲师。”

"He's just in his own world babbling on and on. I zone out with regularity."
“他只是在自己的世界里胡言乱语。我经常走神。”

"I have to say that Shelly Kagan is probably the best lecturer I had in my four years at Yale."
“我不得不说，雪莉·卡根可能是我在耶鲁大学四年里遇到的最好的讲师。”

"He's the type of teacher you either love or hate."
“他是那种你要么爱要么恨的老师。”

Now, that's pretty clearly true. I wish there were some easy litmus test that I could just give you so you'd know which of you would be making a mistake taking this class. I don't know how to give it to you. Next topic: grades.
现在，这显然是正确的。我希望有一些简单的试金石可以给你们，这样你们就知道你们中谁在上这门课时会犯错误。我不知道怎么给你。下一主题：成绩。

Quotes:

"He tried to intimidate us too much with his promise of impossible grading so that everyone took the class credit D fail when we all probably ended up with A's or B's because grading was not hard."
“他试图用不可能的评分来恐吓我们，这样每个人都把课程学分定为 D 不及格，而我们可能最终都得了 A 或 B，因为评分并不难。”

"I recommend it, but only credit D fail. Professor Kagan is harsh with grading."
“我推荐它，但只有D学分不及格。卡根教授对评分很严厉。”

"When Shelly says he's the harshest grader on campus, he isn't lying. I was consistently surprised by how poorly I did on papers. The standards in this class are just different from all other classes."
“当雪莉说他是校园里最严厉的评分者时，他并没有撒谎。我一直对自己的试卷成绩如此糟糕感到惊讶。这个班级的标准与其他班级不同。”

"Kagan's reputation as a harsh grader is unfounded. If you put in the effort, the grade will reflect that."
“卡根作为一个严厉的评分者的声誉是没有根据的。如果你付出努力，评分就会反映出这一点。”

So that settles the question: Am I a harsh grader or not? Now, as you know, the last question for the evaluations is, should you take the class
这样就解决了一个问题：我是否是一个严厉的评分者？现在，如您所知，评估的最后一个问题是，您是否应该参加课程

or not? Would you recommend it to somebody else?
或不？你会把它推荐给别人吗？

Quotes:

"I believe this class is one of the most mind-opening experiences of my life."
“我相信这堂课是我一生中最开放的经历之一。”

"No, it's a waste of a course."
“不，这浪费了课程。”

"It gets kind of depressing at times, but I suppose that's due to the nature of the subject."
“有时会有点令人沮丧，但我想这是由于这个主题的性质造成的。”

"This course stands out as one of the more unique and stimulating courses I have taken at Yale."
“这门课程是我在耶鲁大学修过的最独特、最刺激的课程之一。”

"Excellent class. It made me think about life and death in a new way. What more can you ask for from a class?"
“非常棒的课程。它让我以一种新的方式思考生与死。你还能对课程要求什么呢？”

"I would not recommend it. The class just seemed to be a platform for Kagan to throw out random ideas, and the students were never required to engage in any thought."
“我不会推荐它。这堂课似乎只是卡根抛出随机想法的平台，而学生从来没有被要求参与任何想法。”

Well, that clears that up. Let me end with actually a couple of other quick remarks. These are some of my all-time favorites from previous years.
好吧，这就清楚了。让我以其他几句话结束。这些是我前几年最喜欢的一些。

Quotes:

"Not doing the reading didn't hurt me at all."
“不读书根本没有伤害我。”

Now, of course, these are anonymous comments. I don't know who wrote this comment, but I do know this: whoever wrote this remark is an idiot. Whoever wrote this remark seems to be under the impression that the point of being at Yale is to spend $40,000 a year of your parents' money and get away with learning as little as possible. Well, for those of you who want to try it, you probably could pass this class and maybe even get an okay C-level grade without doing the readings. There's no final exam. But still, it's crucial to understand doing the readings is an important part of learning what this course has to offer.
当然，现在这些都是匿名评论。我不知道这个评论是谁写的，但我知道：写这个评论的人都是个白痴。无论是谁写下这句话，他似乎都有这样的印象：在耶鲁大学的目的就是每年花掉父母的 4 万美元的钱，并尽可能少地学习。好吧，对于那些想尝试的人来说，您可能可以通过这门课，甚至可能在不做阅读的情况下获得不错的 C 级成绩。没有期末考试。但是，了解阅读是学习本课程内容的重要组成部分仍然至关重要。

Quotes:

"Kagan is a self-righteous little man."
“卡根是一个自以为是的小人。”

Now, I've got to tell you, that bit about being little, that really hurts.
现在，我必须告诉你，关于小时候的那一点，真的很痛苦。

Quotes:

"Great course, wonderful professor, fascinating subjects. It's the deepest thinking I've done in my life."
“很棒的课程，很棒的教授，引人入胜的科目。这是我一生中做过的最深刻的思考。”

"This class taught me how to think more than any other at Yale."
“这门课比耶鲁的任何其他课程都更教会我如何思考。”

I don't know whether I pull it off. Pretty obviously, for a number of students, I don't manage to pull it off. But that's at least what my aim is. I'm trying to help you think. I welcome you, and I hope you'll be back on Thursday.
我不知道我能否把它拉下来。很明显，对于许多学生来说，我没能成功。但这至少是我的目标。我正在努力帮助你思考。我欢迎你，希望你周四回来。
