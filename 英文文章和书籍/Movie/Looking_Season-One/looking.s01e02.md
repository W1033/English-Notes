1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,390
我不想考虑太多
I really don't wanna overthink it,

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,240
你们知道我这人的
'cause you know how I can get...

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,390
-是的  -我对今晚很期待的
- Yeah. - ...but I'm feeling pretty excited about tonight.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,340
你这次至少应该给他口
You should at least try to blow him this time.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,600
上次那种情况你要我怎样  他在工作
What was I supposed to do last time? He was working.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,290
我又不会在今夜酒吧的厕所里干那种事
And it's not like I was gonna do it in the toilets of Esta Noche.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,290
为何不可
Why not?

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,400
你去过吗
Have you been in there?

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,650
一点都不性感  脏死了
It's not sexy at all. It's disgusting.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,780
你能相信我们的小伙伴
Can you believe our little brother

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,310
-找了个拉丁裔男友吗  -是啊  难以置信
- is getting himself a cholo boyfriend? - I know.

12
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,920
老天  你个种族主义者
Oh my God. You're such a racist.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,790
我不是  我本身就是拉丁裔
I can't be a racist. I'm Latino.

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,260
你来自科勒尔盖布尔斯[美国佛罗里达州城市]
You're from Coral Gables.

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,930
再说  我可没提男友
And who said anything about a boyfriend?

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,780
也许我就是想找个约炮对象呢
Maybe I just wanna get myself a fuckbuddy.

17
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,360
等等  什么  你能再说一遍吗
Wait, what? Can you say that again,

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,630
这次慢一点
but just a little slower this time?

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,500
约炮对象
A... fuckbuddy.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,540
就你  算了吧
Okay, that's never gonna happen.

21
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,880
你又不知道  这可能是我新的开始
You don't know. This could be a new start for me.

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,940
他可能没割过包皮
Hey, uh, you know he'll probably be uncut

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,220
如果他是真正的墨西哥人的话
if he's a real Mexican.

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,070
-好吧  -你准备好了吗
- Okay. - You prepared for that?

25
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,130
准备  什么意思
Prepared? What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,740
你语气说得好像我要上夜校一样
You make it sound like I should take an evening course.

27
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,710
你应该学习下  真的
Yeah, you should. Hey, it's true.

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,600
我就是说割了和没割的  口活完全是两回事
I'm just saying. It's a whole different ballgame down there.

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,370
你得清楚自己在干什么
You gotta-- you gotta know what you're doing.

30
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,270
你去死吧
Okay, you know what? Fuck you.

31
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,750
我希望他没割
I hope that he is uncut.

32
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,330
我要搞个墨西哥约炮对象
I'm gonna get myself a Mexican fuckbuddy,

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,820
才不管你怎么想
whether you like it or not.

34
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,060
我们得走了
All right, we need to go.

35
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,910
稍等下
Actually, hold up.

36
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,580
拜托
Oh, come on.

37
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,480
跟公主一样难伺候
Such a princess.

38
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,900
真不敢相信他搬走了
I can't believe this is it.

39
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,640
我们有时间在菲茨咖啡馆最后喝杯咖啡吗
Do we have time for one last coffee at Philz?

40
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,340
-求你了  -没有  不行
- Please. - No. No.

41
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,250
说真的  这是我做出的最好的决定
This is the best decision I have ever made, seriously.

42
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,050
-但你喜欢这里  -不再喜欢了
- But you love it here. - Not anymore.

43
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,870
城里都是被高估的纸杯蛋糕和朝鲜泡菜玉米卷
This whole city is overrun with overrated cupcakes, kimchi tacos.

44
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,970
再说  到了奥克兰  我能更专心工作
Plus, I'm gonna be able to get more work done in Oakland.

45
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,580
什么声音  怎么回事
What was that? What is that?

46
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,570
你自己懒  怨在城市身上
Because this entire city is to blame for your laziness.

47
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,590
后面有点重
It's a little heavy back here.

48
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,310
你不知道我在说什么
You don't know what I'm talking about.

49
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,260
没有了干扰  我可以更有干劲
I'll be able to get more done without all the distractions.

50
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,870
伙计们  天啊  我认为我们上不了坡了
Oh my God, Dom. I don't think we're gonna make it up this hill.

51
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,980
没事的  放轻松
We're gonna make it. Just relax.

52
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,580
-这一切都是因为  -好像上不去
- This whole thing is about Frank. - Seem like we're gonna make it.

53
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,090
我和弗兰克想要有新的生活体验  一起体验
and I being open to new experiences, together.

54
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,540
过家家来体验吗
By domesticating?

55
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,960
3P算是过家家吗
Would you call a three-way an act of domesticity?

56
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,520
-等等  什么  -没错
- Wait, what? - Yeah, that's right.

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,700
3P算是过家家吗
Would you call a three-way an act of domesticity?

58
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,660
我听见你说什么了
Yeah, I heard you.

59
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,750
你们3P了  竟然没告诉我
You guys had a three-way and you didn't even tell me?

60
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,780
现在告诉你了
Well, I'm telling you now.

61
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,100
我就说这坡上得来吧
See, I told you we'd make it.

62
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,430
你们3P了
You had a three-way?!

63
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,530
你们什么时候搞的3P
When did you guys have a three-way?

64
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,490
-天呐  -我操  妈呀  开慢点
- Oh my God. - Oh shit. Oh my God, slow down.

65
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,290
踩刹车
Put on the brakes!

66
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,430
-举起你的双手  -你他妈踩点刹车啊
- Hands up in the air! - Put on the fucking brakes!

67
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,770
不好说  我觉得我完全可以搞3P
I don't know. I feel like I could definitely have a three-way,

68
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,930
但得和两个陌生人  而不是跟我男友
but just with two strangers, not with a boyfriend.

69
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,680
为什么不呢
Well, why not?

70
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,040
因为我会吃醋  这样说会不会假正经
Because I'd get jealous. Does that make me a prude?

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,010
天呐  快帮我说说话  多姆
God, help me out, Dom.

72
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,950
我可不要再跟你们讨论这个话题
Oh, I'm not getting into this conversation again.

73
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,080
你俩在这问题上永远有分歧
You two are never gonna agree.

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,840
你得分清两者  性爱和亲密
You just gotta separate the two. You know, sex and intimacy.

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,250
性爱是吸屌和舔屁眼
Sex is getting your cock sucked or getting your ass licked,

76
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,680
-但亲密是另一回事  -不好说
- but intimacy is something else. - I don't know,

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
我觉得舔屁眼够亲密的了
getting your ass licked sounds pretty intimate to me.

78
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,210
天呐  我都忘了这是个地下室
Oh God, I forgot it was a basement apartment.

79
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,600
好阴暗
It's so dark.

80
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,540
不管你喜不喜欢  所有情侣关系
All relationships end up opening in the end,

81
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,840
最后都会变成开放式性关系
whether you like it or not.

82
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,190
何不诚实一点  总好过劈腿
So why not be honest about it, instead of cheating?

83
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,670
所有情侣关系吗  我不信
All of them? I don't think so.

84
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,590
拜托
Oh please.

85
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,850
我爸忍不住要背着我妈出轨
My dad cheated on Mami compulsively.

86
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,220
弗兰克的父母离婚了
Frank's parents got divorced.

87
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,660
我们所有朋友都背着对方胡搞
All of our friends have fooled around.

88
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,950
那也不代表所有情侣关系
Okay, but that doesn't mean all.

89
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,750
只是我们认识的所有人而已
It just means everyone we know.

90
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,870
这个放哪
Where do you want this?

91
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,340
就这后面
Oh uh, back here.

92
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,830
我没背着詹森劈过腿
I never cheated on Jason.

93
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,110
你没机会而已
You didn't have time.

94
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,410
那你是觉得他说得对吗
So you think he's right?

95
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,210
人们就是会出轨的  男人就这样
People usually cheat. Guys are guys.

96
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,490
男人就这样
Guys are guys.

97
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,470
那这意思是你和弗兰克现在处于
Okay, so does that mean that you and Frank

98
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,190
开放式性关系了吗
are in an open relationship now?

99
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,310
还是你们就玩玩3P
Or you're just doing three-ways?

100
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,340
我们在尝试新事物  看看会怎么样
We're trying new things. We'll see what happens.

101
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,560
好吧  如果弗兰克
All right, what if Frank

102
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,360
被20个肌肉猛男操坏了呢
got done up the butt by 20 hot muscle bears?

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,470
你都无所谓吗
You'd be okay with that?

104
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,240
是的
Yeah.

105
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,450
真的吗
Really?

106
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,330
那如果他们射了他一身
What if he's covered in their cum,

107
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,820
而他超享受的
and he loves every second of it,

108
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,810
比跟你做还享受
more than he ever does with you...

109
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,740
简直是最棒的性爱  我认真的
like it's the best sex-- I'm serious--

110
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,630
简直是他有过的最爽性爱体验呢
like it's the best sex that he's ever had?

111
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,890
我无所谓
I would be fine.

112
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,040
你真讨厌
You're so annoying.

113
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,800
弗兰克也无所谓吗
And Frank is really okay with all this?

114
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,610
是的
Yeah, he is.

115
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,840
我都把这家伙给忘了
Oh, I forgot about this guy.

116
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,070
你要把他放哪去
Where's he gonna go?

117
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,260
扔进壁炉烧了
He's gonna go in the fireplace, and I'm gonna burn him.

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,700
天呐  不敢相信就这样了
Oh God. I can't believe this is it.

119
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,290
我觉得告别很奇怪  你会不会觉得我很奇怪
Is it weird I feel weird saying goodbye?

120
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,780
我就想谢谢你这么够朋友
Listen, I just wanted to say thank you for being a friend.

121
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,390
一路起起伏伏
Traveled down the road and back again...

122
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,320
你一直真诚待人
Your heart is true.

123
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,340
你是个好伙伴  好钙蜜
You're a pal and a confidante.

124
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,790
如果你办派对的话...
And if you threw a party--

125
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,890
两位女士不如赶紧互撸一把
Will you ladies please just finger fuck each other already,

126
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,740
-我们好快点出发  -别催了
- so we can get out of here? - You know what? Cool your jets.

127
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,130
快上车  小姐
Get in the car, Rose.

128
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,940
-某人不爽了  -是啊
- Daddy's in a mood. - He is.

129
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,420
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,230
好好享受奥克兰
Enjoy Oakland.

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,290
我猜三个月他就会回来
I give it three months.

132
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,900
我猜五个月  或者六个月
I give it five, maybe six.

133
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,010
到那个时候  我不会再帮那个混蛋搬家了
When it all turns to shit, I'm not moving that fucker again.

134
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,370
-我老了  搬不动了  -知道了
- I'm way too old. - I hear you.

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,290
今天怎么这么暴躁
Why are you so grumpy today?

136
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,520
我没事
I'm okay.

137
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,020
你今天比往常烦人
You seem a little more pissy than usual.

138
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,220
几点了
What time is it?

139
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,870
12:23
12:23.

140
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:54,750
{\an8}奥古斯丁和帕特里克
天长地久  亲亲

141
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,960
能来杯水吗
Can I just get a drip, please?

142
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,050
谢谢
Thank you.

143
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,630
你好  多米尼克
Hello, Dominic.

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,730
你好
Hey.

145
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,170
喝点什么吗  咖啡
Do you want something? Coffee?

146
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,660
不了
No, I'm, uh...

147
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,650
老天  真是很久了
Gosh, it has been a long time.

148
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,530
我戒掉咖啡因了  来杯提神茶吧

299
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,250
我们可以去我家
we could just go back to, my place.

300
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,040
先去其它地方吧
Maybe let's go somewhere else first.

301
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,850
好的  听起来...  行
Yeah, that's -- that's a good -- mm-hmm.

302
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,650
他为什么在洗澡
Why is he taking a shower?

303
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,110
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

304
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,480
我是不是又得去买漂白液
Am I gonna have to buy Clorox again?

305
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,590
不用
No.

306
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,690
{\an8}《女巫前传》中的著名歌曲《Defying Gravity》

307
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,680
我的天  我的天呐
Oh my fucking God. Oh my God.

308
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,830
你为了摆脱痛苦
Did you fuck the pain away

309
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,290
居然跟《女巫前传》的演员搞上啦
with the cast of "Wicked"?

310
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,110
我们浴室里有一个飞猴男孩
There's a -- there's a flying monkey boy in my shower.

311
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,960
天呐  我喜欢他
Oh my God, I love him.

312
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,820
-我觉得我真是爱上他了  -别说了
- Oh no, I think I really do love him. - Stop it.

313
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,250
他好小  像小小的软糖 
He's so teeny. Teeny tiny little gumdrop.

314
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,680
我希望那个鸡蛋能让你吐出来
I hope that egg makes you puke.

315
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,020
事实上我也是这么希望的
God -- I actually hope it does too.

316
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,230
天哪  我好庸俗
God, I'm such a cliche.

317
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,010
你是说你的着装打扮吗
You mean how you dress?

318
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,970
没那么遭啦
It's not that bad.

319
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,250
居然会认为性爱会让我好受点
Thinking that sex will make me feel better.

320
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,870
确实奏效了  但还是...
I mean, it does, but still.

321
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,300
听着  我理解你为什么打给伊桑
Mm. Listen, I get why you called Ethan.

322
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,230
我完全理解
I totally do,

323
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,800
我也明白你为什么和他见了面
and I-I get why you, you know, went to go see him.

324
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,060
我明白你必须经过这个过程
I understand that's your process,

325
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,890
但是我的神啊
but oh my God!

326
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,120
我真希望当时我在场  给那家伙来一拳
I so wish I had been there, so I could neck-punch that dude.

327
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,160
你会比以前更恨他
Oh, but you'd hate him even more.

328
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,300
他现在完全是个洛杉矶人
He's become so LA.

329
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,440
他还喝提神茶呢
He's -- he drinks Refresh tea.

330
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,400
好吧  我要给某人赏一拳
Okay, somebody's gonna get another neck punch.

331
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,900
我最烦这样的人了
That is so annoying to me.

332
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,440
特别是如果他点茶的时候称它为"提神"
Especially if he orders it as "Refresh."

333
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,020
不  他让我去买的
No, he made me order it.

334
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,150
那你把钱要回来了吗
So, uh, did you ask for the money back?

335
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,910
没有
No.

336
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,770
为什么没有
Why not?

337
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,560
我还帮他买了蛋白质盒子
I paid for his fucking Protein Box, too.

338
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,600
我的天
Oh God.

339
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,270
真是郁闷
That is depressing.

340
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,370
要是我这样做
My dirty sock

341
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,970
我的脏袜子会不会让你感觉好点
make you feel better if I go like that?

342
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,570
混蛋
Fucker.

343
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,860
{\an8}卡斯特罗

344
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,110
我的朋友觉得
You know, it's like, my friends think

345
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,840
我像个来自科罗拉多
I'm this, like, boy from Colorado

346
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,530
初入社会的嫩小子
that just is fresh off the bus.

347
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,350
-你来自科罗拉多吗  -但那不是我
- Oh, you're from Colorado? - But I'm not. I'm not that guy.

348
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,670
我有过性经历  知道吗
I like -- I have had sex before, you know?

349
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,500
我想做就能做
Like, I can -- I can do it.

350
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
-我会做的  -好吧

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,370
我现在就可以去厕所来一炮
I could-- I could do it right now in the toilet.

352
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,940
你想跳舞吗  也许我们该去跳舞
You wanna dance? Maybe we should dance.

353

-真的吗  -是的  我喜欢这地方

354
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,670
我能请你喝一杯吗
Can I -- can I buy you a shot?

355
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,220
好的  谢谢
Alright, thank you.

356
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,070

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,700
-哥们  我祖母就叫这名字  -是吗
- Dude, that's my grandmother's name! - Really?

359

我还和客户在一起  所以...

没关系  不会耽误很久的
It's fine. It won't take long.

407
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:56,880
好吧
Okay.

408
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,450

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,390
-我也想你  -停

-好吗  -好吧
- Alright? - Okay.

416
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,870
我意识到...
The thing I realized...

417
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,160
你不值得我浪费那些时间
is that you didn't deserve any of that time,

418
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,160
他妈一分钟也不值得
not a single fucking minute.

419
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,430
我很气自己之前没明白
And I'm just pissed that I didn't get that before.

420
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,940
我们能别在这儿说这个吗
Can we not do this here?

421
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,520
-我的客户...  -真是对不起啊
- My clients are -- - I'm sorry.

422
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,260
不会耽误很久的
It won't take long.

423
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,840
我没有别的要说了
I really don't have anything else to say,

424
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,760
但是我想要回我的八千块
except I want my 8,000 back

425
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,140
再加十年的利息
with 10 years of interest.

426
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,810
你说什么
Excuse me?

427
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,880
还有那该死的薄荷茶和蛋白质餐盒的钱
And what I paid for the peppermint fucking tea

428
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,960
你也得还我
and the protein box.

429
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,880
你他妈在耍我呢
Are you fucking with me?

430
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,140
不  我没在耍你  我给了你那笔钱
No, I'm not fucking with you. I gave you that money...

431
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,450
当时对我可是一大笔钱
and it was a lot of money to me back then.

432
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,940
你也知道  我有自己的规划  
And I had plans and you know that.

433
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,870
对哦  你的"规划"
Right, your plans.

434
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,680
你知道开间餐厅可不只
You do know that it takes more than $8,000

435
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,980
八千块  对吧
to open a restaurant, right?

436
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,540
去死吧你  这不重要
Oh, fuck you. That's not important.

437
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,090
而且那笔钱不是你借我的
And you didn't lend me that money,

438
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,940
是你给我帮我戒毒的
you gave it to me to get sober,

439
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,480
为此我万分感谢
and I'm grateful for that.

440
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,440
是吗
Are you?

441
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,000
是你选择的  不是吗
But you made that choice, didn't you?

442
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,380
你选的
You did.

443
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,660
你果然还是个混蛋
You really still are an asshole.

444
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,460
你怎样看我都无所谓
You know, you can -- you can think of me whatever you want,

445
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,910
我无法改变你的想法
and I can't change that.

446
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,670
但你不能怪我
But you can't blame me,

447
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,530
只能怪你自己
you can only blame yourself.

448
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,270
这是我这一路走来领悟到的
That's what I've learned on my journey,

449
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,940
希望你一切顺利
and I wish you the best on yours, okay?

450
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,410
去你妈的一路走来
Hey hey hey. You fuck your journey,

451
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,730
顺你妈的利
and your wish can suck my dick.

452
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,330
抱歉
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,770
知道吗  他会骗死你的
He'll screw you over, you know?

454
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,610
真狗改不了吃屎
Once a meth-head motherfucker, always a meth-head motherfucker.

455
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,770
该死的皮带
Oh, fucking belt.

456
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,210
老天  我去
Jesus, motherfucker.

457
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,510
好  必须把裤子给脱下来
Okay, these pants are coming off.

458
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,320
老天  你的牛仔裤真紧身  操
God, you wear tight jeans. Motherfucker!

459
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,380
老天啊
Jesus Christ!

460
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,240
-怎么了  -什么
- What? - What?

461
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,600
你不能"啊"一下就没声了
You can't just say "oh", and then say nothing.

462
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,280
没什么  没事
It's nothing, it's nothing.

463
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,710
我只是...没事
I just...no.

464
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,770
怎么啦
What?

465
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,130
你只是什么
You just what?

466
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,830
没什么  我只是以为...
No. Nothing. I just thought that...

467
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,380
我只是以为你可能还没割包皮
I just thought that, you know, maybe you might be uncut.

468
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,560
好吧
Okay.

469
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,850
是的
Yeah.

470
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,860
你好像很失望
You sound disappointed.

471
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,060
有点失望
I'm a little disappointed.

472
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,270
开玩笑的啦
I'm completely kidding.

473
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,010
我有点洁癖  所以这样更好
I'm a sucker for cleanliness, so this is actually much better.

474
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,830
-天呐  -怎么
- Wow, man. - What?

475
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,100
你吓到我了
You got me trippin'.

476
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,110
吓到  别啊  别怕
Trippin'? No, don't trip.

477
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,240
感觉怪怪的
This is weird.

478
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,590
不不不  都怪我那群狐朋狗友
No no no! Listen, it's just my stupid friends.

479
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,040
和万恶的网络
And the internet.

480
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,180
什么
What?

481
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,400
是他们逼我看网上那些图片的
They made me look at pictures on the internet.

482
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,900
但也没什么大不了的
You know, but it's not a big deal.

483
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,070
-我觉得...  -怎么
- I think... - Yeah?

484
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,860
怎么了
What?

485
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,600
我得走了
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

486
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,780
别
No.

487
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,330
别  你说真的吗
No, are...are you serious?

488
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,360
真的  我觉得我们不是一路人
Yeah, I think we're looking for different things.

489
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,410
这没什么  没关系
It's no big deal. It's cool.

490
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,890
别担心  没事
Don't worry about it, don't sweat it.

491
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,060
喂
Hello?

492
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,940
好吧  我这边不顺利
Okay, so that didn't go well.

493
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,660
你做什么了
Well, what did you do?

494
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,690
本来一切很顺利  直到...
Well, everything was going fine until...

495
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,790
我表现得满脑子都想舔他没割包皮的弟弟
I acted like all I wanted to do was suck on his uncut cock,

496
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,450
结果他其实割过包皮的
which, it turns out, he doesn't even actually have.

497
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,580
我觉得我可能也有点种族歧视
I think I may be a racist as well.

498
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,900
见鬼  怎么会这样
Oh shit. That's-that's not good at all.

499
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,050
糟透了  我都不知道我到底怎么了
Mm, it's terrible. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

500
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,570
感觉...  他人真心不错
It's like...he's a really good guy,

501
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,690
但我们一在一起
but we get together,

502
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,530
我他妈就跟疯了一样
and I just start acting like a fuckin' crazy person.

503
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,920
不不  好吧  抱歉
No no no, okay okay, I'm sorry.

504
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,350
我不该笑你的  抱歉
I don't mean to laugh at you, sorry.

505
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,420
没事
No, that's okay.

506
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,910
对了  谢谢...
Oh, thanks for the, uh...

507
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
谢谢你在我墙上留的涂鸦
thanks for the graffiti on my wall, by the way.

508
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,560
代表一个时代的完结嘛
Well, it's the end of an era.

509
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,240
是的  确实如此
It is. It really is.

510
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,170
我挺喜欢的  我要把它留着
I really like it. I think I'm gonna keep it.

511
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,290
很好  不错  这让我感到很高兴
Good good, man. I'm glad.

512
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,050
真心的
I meant it.

513
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,380
我知道
I know you did.

514
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,790
你在吃什么
What are you -- what are you eating?

515
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,980
什么
Hmm?

516
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,690
你在吃奇怪的东西  是什么
You're eating something weird. What is that?

517
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,780
我在吃沙拉
I'm just having a salad.

518
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,000
甘蓝沙拉
Kale salad.

519
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,700
配鸡肉
With chicken.
