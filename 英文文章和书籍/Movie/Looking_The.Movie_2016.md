to make a new man out of him.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,569
-住手  -我們得多喝點

上次來是多久之前了
How long has it been since we've been here?

工作太忙了
It's just that work has been super hectic,

32
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,158
臉書停更也沒用
and it doesn't help that I deactivated my Facebook.

33
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:23,079
但都不是借口
But that's not an excuse.

34
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,712
別擔心 一切都好
Don't worry. It's all going fine.

35

That's amazing. It's getting there.

38
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:31,527
而且他答應我
And he promised me tonight

39
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,767
今晚不看店 一次都不去
he wouldn't check the window, not even once.

40
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,752
-沒準看一次吧  -不行 你發過誓的
- Maybe just once. - No. No, you swore.

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,160
門都沒有
Not even a fuckin' text, okay?

42
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,599
好吧 我的天
Okay. Jesus.

43

藝校怎麼樣
How's the Art Institute?

44
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,992
那些藝校的小混蛋們
Oh, these punk art school brats,

45
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:43,561
一點都不愛惜設備
they have no respect for the equipment,

46
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:45,692
但我現在基本上付得起房租了

47
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,648
-基本上 -也算進步了

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,040
你不懷念這裏嗎
You don't miss it here?

150
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,730
我想你們 我當然想念這裏的人
I miss you guys. I miss the people, for sure.

151
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,650
但城市都大同小異
But in a lot of ways, the cities are very similar,

152
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,820
一樣的小袋咖啡 韓國肉丸
it's the same small batch coffee, the same Korean meat-balls,

153
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,660
除了那裏的人不太像舊金山人
except people there are a little less, you know, San Francisco.

154
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,990
舊金山人可能會討人嫌
In the way that people in San Francisco can be annoying.

155
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,030
我都懂
I totally get it.

156
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,480
但是丹佛人很酷
But the Denver people, they're really cool.

157
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,390
有基佬嗎 丹佛有基佬嗎
Are there any gays... Are there any gays in Denver?

158
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,560
有啊 還挺多 畢竟大城市
Yeah, there's a lot of gays, it's a big city,

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
小帕作為城裏唯一的牛仔女郎
And Paddy's been making

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,360
可算搶手貨
the most of being the single cowgirl in town.

161
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,470
-這倒是  -天哪
- I have, indeed. - Oh god.

162
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,260
他們就跟《斷背山》一樣
They're like Brokeback Mountain,

163
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,370
就像跟傑克·吉倫哈爾上床那樣嗎
are you just like having sex with Jake Gyllenhaal?

164
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,910
不 但我這背山可是斷了好幾次
No, but, I broke this back mountain a couple times.

165
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,370
妹妹 你變了
Girl, you changed.

166
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,220
我不敢相信我帶了這破包
I can't believe I have this stupid bag.

167
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,130
你髮型不錯
Your hair looks good.

168
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,390
-謝謝  -頭髮剪短了
- Thank you. - Kept it short, huh?

169
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,740
-是啊  -剪短了...
- I did. Yeah. - Short on the...

170
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,920
剪短了兩邊
Yeah, short on the sides.

171
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,650
見到你真高興
It's good to see you.

172
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,770
我也是
You, too.

173
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,440
抱歉之前沒聯繫
Sorry I was so incommunicado,

174
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,420
那時候就覺得
but it just felt like the

175
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,150
安頓下來了就該...
right thing to do while I got settled and...

176
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,620
不用解釋
You don't need to explain.

177
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,960
但我離開得太突然 什麼也沒說
Yeah, but I left so suddenly without much of an explanation.

178
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,910
-你也是身不由己  -是啊
- You did what you had to do. - I did.

179
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,010
那就別擔心了
So don't sweat it.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,820
好吧
All right.

181
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,820
回家感覺怎麼樣 跟熟人這麼近
So what's it like being back home, so close to your folks ?

182
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,780
我是離家近 還沒到家
I'm near home, I'm not at home,

183
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,890
50分鐘車程還是挺長的
and that 50 minute car-ride makes all the difference.

184
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,350
但一切還算順利
But it's been pretty positive.

185
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,860
沒想到我能在那做自己
I never thought that I could actually be there and be myself,

186
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,700
也算進步了
so that feels like progress.

187
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,140
-那挺好  -是啊
- That's good. - Yeah.

188
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,310
你媽還行嗎
And how's your mom ?

189
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,690
她還好
She's all right.

190
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,750
我在她身邊 也不責備她離開我爸
It's probably helpful I was there and only semi-judgmental

191
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,490
可能會好點
about her choice to drop my dad.

192
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,900
他們離婚你怎麼想
How are you about the divorce?

193
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,210
-我  -對
- Me? - Yeah.

194
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,450
-我都30了  -沒什麼關係
- I'm thirty. - I don't think that matters.

195
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,570
她為那人拋棄我爸後 又把那人甩了
You know, she actually dumped the guy that she left my dad for,

196
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,460
現在和她的理療醫生薩珀斯坦睡在一起
and now she's having sex with her therapist, Dr. Saperstein.

197
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,750
-真的  -騙你幹嘛
- Really? - Yeah.

198
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,980
她不惹出點麻煩來就他媽手癢
She really likes to make a fucking mess of things.

199
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,530
不過 有其母必有其子吧
But then, like mother like son, I guess.

200
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,210
我就不說了
I'm saying nothing.

201
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,230
我...
So I...

202
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
最後還是聽了你的話
I finally followed your advice

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,510
-努力跟我爸和好  -挺好
- and tried to work things out with my dad. - Good.

204
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,020
但你這主意太餿了
It turns out that advice totally sucked.

205
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,410
我去 真的
Oh shit, really?

206
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,070
是啊 我努力接受
Yeah. I tried to honor the fact

207
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,170
他不可能真正接受我本性的事實
that he would never really be completely happy with who I am,

208
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,830
我努力尋找共識 但...
and tried to find a common ground, but...

209
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,760
沒有嗎
There was none?

210
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,330
他就是恐同
Turns out he is a raging homophobe.

211
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,920
就好像他一理解我
It's like him trying to understand me

212
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,140
就會三觀盡毀似的 所以...
undermines everything he thinks he knows about himself. So...

213
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,240
我的天
Oh god.

214
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,670
你覺得他會理解嗎
Do you think he'll ever come around?

215
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,080
他就一黃牛背上的跳蚤 估計不會
He's a proud fucker, so probably not.

216
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,720
那...
Well...

217
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,720
如果我像我媽 那...
If I'm like my mom, then...

218
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,670
閉嘴
Shut up.

219
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,350
佈雷迪倒是看得挺開
But Brady has been really cool about the whole thing.

220
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,180
他一直挺支持我 挺安慰的
He's been super supportive, so that's helped.

221
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,110
真好 理發車怎麼樣了
Good. What about the barber truck?

222
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,080
我聽說不錯
I've been hearing amazing things.

223
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,840
-是不錯  -你不想念威利理髮店嗎
- It's going really well. - And you don't miss Willy's?

224
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,020
想啊 不過自己創業也不錯
Yeah, but it's also good to be doing my own thing.

225
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,800
奧古斯丁漆車功力了得
Actually Agustin did a really great job with the paint-work on it.

226
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,260
他挺厲害
He's really good.

227
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,390
可以想像你開車經過巴倫西亞
I can just picture you cruising down Valencia

228
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,570
招攬人進車理發
luring people into your truck for a fade.

229
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,860
真挺好
It's kind of perfect.

230
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,870
有時候我想開車到裏諾
Sometimes, I want to drive to Reno

231
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,630
在賭場停車場裏給人燙髮
and start doing perms in some casino parking lot.

232
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,590
-什麼  -做點與眾不同的事嘛
- What? - Just to do something different, you know?

233
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,090
我的天
Oh, my god.

234
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,080
那要不然是最牛的真人秀 要不然是最爛的
That would be the best reality show, ever. Or maybe the worst.

235
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,540
都差不多
It's basically the same thing.

236
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,830
你該過來 看看我剪頭髮
You should come by some time. See me in action.

237
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,080
好啊 會的
Yeah. I'd like that.

238
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,810
一定找機會來 肯定的
If not this trip, then the next one, for sure.

239
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,470
他們在這呢
Here they are!

240
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,690
-還以為把你們弄丟了  -都怪這包
- We thought we'd lost you. - I know, it's this bag.

241
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,820
奧古斯丁把我說服了 我現在支持結婚
Agustin has totally convinced me. I'm pro-marriage now.

242
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,380
你個該死的叛徒
You fuckin' traitor.

243
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,160
-想結婚  -現在
- You wanna get married? - Right now?

244
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,150
-現在就算了吧  -走著
- Maybe not right now. - Come on!

245
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,480
你還好嗎
You all right?

246
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,580
-很好  -那就好
- I'm good. - Good.

247
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,220
-你呢  -還好 有點累了
- How you feelin'? - I'm good. I'm a little tired.

248
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,760
-你要唱歌嗎  -要
- You gonna sing? - Yeah!

249
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,510
棒
Oh good.

250
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,690
你要唱什麼 咱們合唱什麼
What are you gonna sing? What are we gonna sing together?

251
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,618
那我們一起吧
Let's do this.

252
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,580
你選的都是我們從前常去的地方
I love that you've chosen all of our old haunts.

253
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,910
我覺得要重返作案現場
Yeah, I felt like I needed to return to the scenes of my crimes.

254
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,000
再犯一樁
Like one more time.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,390
-你又不是要死了  -我知道
- You're not dying. - I know, but

256
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,450
但"結婚"這事讓我覺得
this whole getting married thing is making me feel all...

257
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,980
引號就不必加了
I don't think that the air quotes are necessary.

258
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,430
我去
Oh, shit.

259
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,300
-準新娘  -你來了
- Bride to be. - You made it.

260
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,520
-必須的  -穆雷小姐
- Come on. Of course. - Miss Murray!

261
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,030
最近可好
How's it going?

262
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,140
很好 你是坐協和號從巴黎飛過來的嗎
Good, you took the Concorde in from Paris, n'est ce pas?

263
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,460
是是 見到你真好 真是驚喜
Oui. Oui. Yes. It's so good to see you. What a surprise!

264
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,900
兩位小姐要喝點什麼 我請
What are you ladies drinking? I'm buying.

265
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,780
-便宜又烈的  -像你一樣
- Something cheap and strong. - Yeah, just like you.

266
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,770
-好吧 我承認  -我開玩笑的
- All right. I'll take it. - I'm kidding.

267
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,720
你倆現在是朋友了 真朋友
So, you guys are friends, now, like actual friends?

268
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,740
-對  -誰先聯繫對方的
-Yeah. - Who reached out to who?

269
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,330
我覺得我得把這一章翻篇
I felt like I needed to close that chapter

270
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,990
才能開始新篇章 所以
before I opened a new one, so yeah

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,150
我叫他過來了 我告訴你了吧
I called him up. I thought I told you.

272
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,710
很好啊 他一直是個好人
No, it's great. I mean, he's always been a good guy.

273
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,350
是啊 我倆沒成
Yeah, you know. Just because it didn't work out

274
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,560
不代表不能做朋友
doesn't mean it couldn't turn into something new.

275
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,290
埃迪也無所謂
Plus Eddie's cool with it.

276
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,580
-那當然  -他最好了
- Of course he is. - He's the best.

277
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,440
他最好了
He's the best.

278
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,950
那個 你跟我一起唱
BT dubs, you and I are singing.

279
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,360
不行 不不不
Oh, no. No no no no...

280
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,650
-來嘛  -不不不
- Oh, come on. - No no no.

281
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,860
我愛你 可我唱歌就是車禍現場
I love you, but bad things happen when I get behind a microphone.

282
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,240
-不 絕對震撼 來嘛  -不
- No, badass things happen. Please. - No!

283
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,210
我的天
Oh, my god!

284
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,570
他幹嘛不看我一眼
Why isn't he making eye contact with me?

285
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,800
他應該看著我
He should be looking at me.

286
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,400
對我唱
Sing to me.

287
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,830
我記得 我記得
I remember, I remember, I remember.

288
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,030
我覺得他的原話是
I think, I think his exact words were,

289
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,960
我寧願禁閉後庭 再不吸屌
I'd rather seal up my butthole and never suck another cock again

290
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,070
也不要結婚
rather than get married.

291
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,750
真不敢相信基佬會那麼想變直
I can't believe that gay people are so fucking desperate to be straight.

292
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,560
他們已經不配再叫基佬了
They shouldn't even be called gay any more.

293
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,910
我真那麼惹人嫌嗎
God, did I really sound that annoying?

294
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,710
相信我 你沒有 他就是張臭嘴
No, trust me, you don't, he was a total cunt.

295
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,700
毒舌的奧古斯丁哪去了 他在派對上多逗
I miss the cunty Agustin. He was fun at parties.

296
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,120
你變成了你一直討厭的那種基佬
You've become one of those gay guys you always hated.

297
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,560
你馬上會收養孩子
Soon you'll be adopting babies

298
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,650
然後和其他白蓮基去家庭度假了
and going on family cruises with the other Stepford homos.

299
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,320
-別說了  -別聽他們亂說 奧古斯丁
- Leave him alone. - Don't listen to them, Agustin.

300
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,970
我覺得你的選擇很好
I think that what you're doing is amazing.

301
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,110
沒關係 小帕 我不介意
It's OK, Paddy, I can take it.

302
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,820
你知道我開玩笑的 就找你茬 我替你高興
You know I'm kidding. I'm messing around with you. I'm thrilled for you.

303
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,120
我覺得埃迪是你生命的一道光
I think that Eddie is a shining light of awesomeness in your life.

304
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,430
你的選擇很明智
And you're doing it for the right reasons.

305
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,340
所以幹嘛不勇敢愛呢
So, what's there not to love?

306
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,260
謝謝你 弗蘭克 這話真好
Thank you, Frank. That was beautiful.

307
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,480
別搞砸了
Just don't fuck it up.

308
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,480
比如 從遠離鴨開始
Like, stay away from rent boys for a start.

309
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,640
我知道我剛才說不 但是去他的 上吧
I know that I said I wouldn't, but fuck it. Let's do this.

310
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,910
-要唱歌了嗎  -對 唱歌了
- We're gonna sing? - Yes, we're gonna sing.

311
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,770
-我可以當丁日嗎  -可以 可以
- Can I finally be Justin? - Yes, you can!

312
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,850
唱吧
Let's do it!

313
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,380
來吧
Let's do this!

314
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,120
我再也不吸屌了
I will never suck a cock again!

315
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,130
我的建議就是 遠離鴨
That's my advice, stay away from rent boys.

316
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,120
這是我和小帕在這座城市裏
This was actually the first club

317
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,620
去的第一家夜店
me and Paddy ever came to in the city.

318
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,780
也是我和小帕搞上的地方
It's also where me and Paddy hooked up.

319
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,420
是的 沒錯
Yes, it was.

320
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
等一下
Hold on a second.

321
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,170
肌肉瑪麗和白蓮花 去死吧
Muscle Mary and goodie-two-shoes, get the fuck outta here.

322
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,220
白蓮花 不是吧
Goodie-two-shoes, really?

323
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,460
我怎麼不知道你倆搞過
I didn't know you guys hooked up.

324
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,400
是的 但那是很久之前
Yes, but it was a long time ago

325
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,130
沒必要再來一遍
and we do not need to go back there.

326
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,220
-有必要  -不 沒必要
- Yeah we do. - No, we do not.

327
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,030
快講 快講 快講
Story! Story! Story!

328
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,580
很久以前 有一位叫小帕的小公主
Once upon a time there was a pretty princess called Paddy,

329
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,450
他孤身一人 醉得不省人事
he was all by himself, poor lonely baby, totally wasted

330
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,090
跟著布蘭妮的歌跳舞 記得嗎
and dancing to Britney, remember?

331
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,850
記得
I do.

332
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,620
我猜你們都看過小帕喝醉酒跳舞吧
I'm assuming we've all seen Paddy's drunk dancing.

333
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,630
我看過
I have.

334
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,320
-什麼樣的  -挺起勁
- What's it like? - Enthusiastic.

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,020
你倆睡了嗎
Did you guys fuck?

336
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
不算是睡吧
I wouldn't say fuck.

337
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,470
也就是躺一塊擼一炮
It was more like side by side jerking off,

338
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,810
不過我記得差點給你口了
although I do remember almost giving you a blowjob.

339
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,260
我記得你舔邊上 但是不願意含進去
I remember you licking the side but refusing to put the tip in.

340
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,170
我那時候怕染病嘛
What can I say? I was very disease-phobic in those days.

341
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,160
我當年很厭惡自己
I had a lot of self-loathing back then.

342
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,030
當年
Back then?

343
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,450
開玩笑吧 開玩笑的吧
That was a joke! That was a joke!

344
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,640
很高興你只是趴在我肩上哭
I'm glad you cried on my shoulder

345
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,160
我沒讓神龍進你小穴
I didn't put my dick in your butt

346
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,530
看看你我如今的樣子
because look where we are now.

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,520
是啊
That's true.

348
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,490
-對吧  -沒錯
- Right? - Yeah.

349
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,770
騷雞們
Hey, faggots!

350
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,610
我的天 真開心你專程回來
Oh my god, I am so glad you came in for this.

351
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,350
伴娘不來 他肯定不辦婚禮
He never would have did it without his maid of dishonor.

352
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,550
這麼重大的事我怎麼能不來
I wouldn't have missed this for the world,

353
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,150
開什麼玩笑
are you kidding? Please.

354
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,300
我朋友 傑克
And this is my friend Jake.

355
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,040
我在芝加哥最早結交的 也是最好的朋友
He's my oldest and dearest from Chicago.

356
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,740
我正勸他搬過來
I'm trying to get him to move here,

357
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,520
所以你倆好好聊
so please play nice with others!

358
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,250
傑克 來見見多姆 多姆
Jake, I want you to meet Dom. Dom?

359
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,530
他看過你照片 很想嘗嘗你的雞
He saw your pic and he really wants to taste your chicken.

360
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,960
好吧 怎麼了
OK. What?

361
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,630
什麼意思
What was that?

362
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,130
-他好萌 你好幾個月沒開張了  -沒錯
- He's cute. You've literally had nothing for months. - Exactly!

363
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,050
而且 據埃迪說
Plus, from what Eddie says,

364
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,730
他有全伊利諾斯最美的屌
he has the most beautiful penis in all of Illinois.

365
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,560
寶貝 來和我跳舞
Come baby, dance with me,

366
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,180
最後一次當單身妹妹
our last time as single girls.

367
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,130
-好吧   -中西美妞
- All right. - A nice Midwestern girl.

368
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,480
怎麼了
What?

369
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,700
他真的很萌 我覺得你該上
He's really cute. I feel like you should go for it.

370
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,890
你壞水桃瑞絲一樣多
You're as bad as Doris.

371
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,320
得了吧
Oh, come on!

372
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,960
-哪裏不好 等等 我去尿尿  -好吧
- What's the harm? Wait, wait, I gotta pee, I gotta pee. - OK.

373
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,290
等下我想看你們跳舞 你倆一起
I wanna see you guys on the dance floor later. Both of you.

374
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,880
龍舌蘭 龍舌蘭
Tequila? Tequila?

375
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,650
我想跳舞
I wanna dance on the bar.

376
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,990
我上次來這的時候穿著皮馬甲
Last time I was here, I was in a leather vest.

377
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,880
我記得
I remember.

378
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,150
好像很久之前了
That seems like a long time ago.

379
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,630
沒錯
It does.

380
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,300
我很高興你離開了
I'm glad you left, you know?

381
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,100
-什麼  -懂我意思嗎
- What ? - You know what I mean?

382
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,900
那挺要膽量
It took a lot of guts,

383
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,140
而且看上去對你大有好處
and it seems to have done you a lot of good.

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,450
你真這樣覺得
You think?

385
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,090
有時候只有放下過去 才能重新向前
Sometimes you gotta leave things behind so you can move forward.

386
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,540
-我給你拿了杯龍舌蘭  -真好 謝謝
- I got you a tequila. - Good, thank you!

387
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,800
你沒喝過吧  便宜貨
You haven't tasted it yet, it's the cheap stuff.

388
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,690
-乾杯  -乾杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

389
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,250
-真是便宜貨  -快滾去舞池跳舞
- That is the cheap stuff. - Get your ass out on the dance floor.

390
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,120
我怎麼抗拒布蘭妮的召喚
How could I resist the call of Britney ?

391
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,750
你來嗎
You coming?

392
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,980
我想還得來一杯
I think I need another drink first

393
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,110
但是很期待看你跳
but looking forward to see you move.

394
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,050
聽不見你說話
I can't hear you.

395
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,120
裏奇
Richie!

396
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,650
好吧  跳舞吧
Fine. Let's just dance.

397
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,210
真是個老司機
Wow, you're really good at that.

398
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,700
我一直練著呢
I've been training.

399
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,520
我想要你干我
I think I want you to fuck me.

400
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,850
你不想的話就算了
We don't have to if you don't want to,

401
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,120
-不想幹我嗎  -想
- Don't you want to fuck me? - Yeah.

402
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,320
那就來吧
Then do it.

403
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,590
操  爽
Fuck, you feel so good.

404
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,450
能稍微慢點嗎
Can you put the brakes on, a bit?

405
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,450
好 抱歉 疼嗎
Year, sorry, is it hurting?

406
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,080
別臭美了
Don't flatter yourself.

407
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,400
不  我只是不想射的太...
No, I just don't want to cum too...

408
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,170
來不及了 快點吧 快點
OK, it's way too late for that, just go faster, faster.

409
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,570
操  我要射了
Fuck. I'm gonna cum.

410
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,540
在贊戈工作怎麼樣
So, how do you like it at Zynga?

411
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,750
免費吃花生巧克力 當然好
You get free Reese's Pieces, so what's not to love?

412
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,620
他們就用糖吸引你去
That's how they get you. All that sugar.

413
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,980
當心點 別掉進坑裏
You gotta watch out, you don't want to get stuck in their fly traps.

414
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,130
所以你就你離開了MDG
Is that why you left MDG?

415
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,660
差不多
Something like that.

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,740
說嘛 說嘛
Come on, spill the beans.

417
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,920
好吧 我和老闆撩上了
Okay, fine. I was in a relationship with my boss.

418
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,340
但分手後
But after we broke up,

419
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,620
上班就跟《電鋸驚魂》似的
going into the office was like that movie Saw,

420
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,690
只不過沒有銬在牆上的小鮮肉
except without the cute guy chained to the wall.

421
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,070
不會是凱文·馬西森吧
It wasn't Kevin Matheson, was it?

422
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,330
什麼
What?

423
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,470
天吶 就是他 對吧
My god, it was, wasn't it?

424
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
何出此言
Why do you say that?

425
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,660
我知道他在那工作 他又是基佬
I know he works there, and he's gay.

426
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,190
所以我討厭這座城市 太小了
That's why I hate this fucking city, it's so small.

427
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,450
別告訴我你跟他睡過
Please don't tell me that you had sex with him.

428
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,130
不  不  但我挺願意的
No, no, but I would.

429
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,320
天吶  那對耳朵
Oh god. Those ears,

430
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,660
簡直可以看著它們來一發
I would tug on those babies.

431
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,570
我在一月時和他面試
I did interview with him though, back in January.

432
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,760
天吶 我的工作
Oh, my god, for my job.

433
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,300
沒被錄用
Anyway. I didn't get it.

434
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,650
聽說他雇了個十九歲的洛杉磯騷受
I heard he hired a 19 year old muscle queen from LA.

435
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,820
當然了
Of course, he did.

436
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
你們現在不聯繫了吧
I take it you two don't talk?

437
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,510
你和凱文
You and Kevin?

438
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,570
沒有 但他不時打錢給我
Talk, no, but he PayPals me every now and again

439
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,440
付一起開發的遊戲的利潤分成
for this game we designed together.

440
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,510
-大款呀  -要是就好了
- Cha-ching. - I wish.

441
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,530
只要不用在收件箱裏看到他名字
I would so happily give up those ninety dollars

442
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,930
那九十塊美金我寧願不要
just so I didn't have to see his name in my in-box.

443
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,510
那為什麼不呢
So, why don't you?

444
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,820
要徹底埋葬過去
You have to bury your dead real good, you know,

445
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,210
過去才不會捲土重來傷害你
so they don't come back and haunt you.

446
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,640
你怎麼這麼機靈
Who made you so fucking wise?

447
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,200
怎麼 我22歲了 男朋友一把
What? I'm twenty-two, I've had my fair share of boyfriends.

448
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,600
真的 才22
Really, at twenty-two?

449
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,020
肯定很小就開始交男朋友了
You must have started pretty young.

450
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,840
16歲
Sixteen.

451
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,150
你16歲就有男朋友了
You had a boyfriend when you sixteen years old?

452
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,490
對
Yeah.

453
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,110
凱文他攻力超足 對吧
He's quite butch, isn't he? Kevin.

454
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,870
他雙腿叉開的時候就不那麼攻了
He's not so butch when he's got his legs in the air.

455
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,690
他是不是個飢渴受
Is he a hungry bottom?

456
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,870
-超飢渴  -天 太棒了
- Super hungry. - Oh, my god, that's awesome.

457
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,640
那你是因為他才離開舊金山嗎
So is he why you left San Francisco?

458
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,200
凱文 不 不全是
Kevin, no, he's not getting full credit for that.

459
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,290
那你為什麼離開
Then, why did you leave?

460
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
原因很複雜
A lot of different reasons.

461
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,910
實話說
To be honest,

462
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,090
是我搞砸了
I sort of made a mess of

463
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,840
跟另一個人的感情
this other relationship with someone else I was with.

464
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,380
-看來有料  -沒錯
- I'm sensing a theme. - Yeah, exactly.

465
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,500
和凱文分手後  我才意識到自己有多蠢
Then after Kevin, I realized what an idiot I'd been,

466
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,980
但為時已晚
but it was too late then.

467
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,040
船已經開走了
That ship had sailed.

468
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,750
-我很遺憾  -不 不用
- I'm sorry. - No, don't be.

469
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,860
其實那對彼此都好
It was actually the best thing for both of us.

470
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,730
說實在的 即便那船沒開走
And the truth is, even if that ship hadn't sailed,

471
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,010
我可能也會在啟航前
I probably would have found a way to sink it

472
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,760
弄沉它
before it left the harbor, anyway.

473
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,470
所以你就走了
So, off you went.

474
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,230
對  所以我去了丹佛
Yes, so then I went to Denver

475
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,830
而且發誓絕不談戀愛
and I swore myself off relationships completely in the process

476
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,200
長期看 這可能對大家都好
which was probably better for everyone in the long run.

477
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,870
但是
But

478
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,840
我也厭倦自己的生活
it was also about just being tired

479
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,190
停滯不前 明白嗎
of my life not moving forward, you know?

480
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,620
至少沒上正軌
Or at least not moving in the right direction.

481
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,990
離開就是按下復位鍵 重新開始
Going away was about pressing the reset button and starting over.

482
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,040
-明白嗎  -當然
- Do you know what I mean? - Sure, yeah.

483
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,380
然後呢
And, so?

484
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,410
然後什麼
So, what?

485
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,800
有用嗎 復位鍵有用嗎
Did it work? The reset, did it work?

486
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,770
-早 懶鬼  -早
- Hey, lazy bones. - Hi.

487
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,200
你可以睡你原來的床上
You could have slept in your old bed.

488
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,280
我以為...不是那個傑克在裏面嗎
I thought... Wasn't that Jake guy in there?

489
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,090
沒有  當然沒有
No, of course not.

490
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,810
謝謝
Thank you.

491
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,860
奧古斯丁在埃迪家 你本來可以睡他房間
And Agustin's at Eddie's place, you could have slept in his room.

492
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,490
你確定不會讓我看起來很淫蕩嗎
Are you sure it doesn't make me a slut?

493
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,700
-能讓你感覺很爽嗎  -多半能
- Does it make you feel positive? - Most of the time.

494
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,690
那就行
There you go.

495
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,650
之後就不知道了
Then, afterwards, I don't know.

496
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,270
-發生什麼了  -沒什麼
- What happened? - Nothing happened.

497
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,710
那怎麼回事
Then what?

498
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,320
不知道 大概因為我去了科羅拉多
I don't know, maybe it's that I went away to Colorado

499
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,330
所有煩心事都拋到一邊
and everything was out of sight and out of mind,

500
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,170
現在我回來了 煩心事也都回來了
and now I'm back, and then there it all is.

501
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,190
什麼煩心事
There what is?

502
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,160
-所有我本以為已經搞定的事  -比如說
- Everything I thought I'd dealt with. - Like what?

503
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,720
你覺得我要不要去找凱文
Do you think I should see Kevin while I'm here?

504
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,110
老天 你怎麼會有這種想法
Oh, god. Why would you even think about doing that?

505
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,570
我不知道 就是和過去做個了斷
I don't know. Just to close the chapter, bury the dead.

506
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,560
看看他是不是變胖變醜了
See if he's gotten fat and gross.

507
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,460
腦補他變胖變醜 繼續好好活
Just assume he's gotten fat and gross, and move on.

508
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,880
你說得對
You're right.

509
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,970
當然 相信我
Yeah, I am, trust me.

510
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,450
天啊 我都忘了你有個休息站了
Oh, my god. I forgot that you have a parklet!

511
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,900
-沒錯  -天哪 看上去超棒
- Yeah! - Holy shit. It looks so good!

512
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,590
是吧
Right?

513
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,690
如果這都不能說明你成功了
If this doesn't mean you've made it

514
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,090
就沒什麼可以說明了
I don't know what does.

515
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,130
帶女兒上班還是什麼
Is it bring your daughter to work day or something?

516
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,900
-你在這幹嘛  -你來這幹嘛
- What are you doing here? - What are you doing here?

517
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,320
我來找你談談 不是來找你說話的
I came to talk to you. I didn't come to talk to you.

518
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,570
-回家吧  -對不起 我先回去
- Go home. - I'm sorry, I can go home.

519
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,190
不 沒事 來吧
No, it's fine. Fine. Please.

520
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,850
有人想先來個甜甜圈嗎 我快餓死了
Does anybody first to have a donut? I'm starving.

521
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,690
還有你們宿醉怎麼辦
And what do you do for a hangover?

522
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,040
我想吐
And I want to throw up.

523
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,850
他也迷上了多姆
And he was totally into Dom, too.

524
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,660
確實 挺好的 他人好嗎
He was, great. And, was he nice?

525
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,750
人很好
He was very nice.

526
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,470
所以你和他上床了嗎 他會搬來和你一起住
So did you fuck him? Is he gonna move in with you?

527
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,310
還幫你把圍裙上的油垢洗掉嗎
Help you clean the grease stains off your aprons?

528
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,690
不會 都不會
No. No to both of those,

529
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,140
我們真的需要再廢話一遍嗎
and do we really need to have this conversation again?

530
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,100
再 我們又說了一遍 怎麼可能
Again? We're having it again, how can that be?

531
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,980
我幾個月沒見你了
I haven't seen you in months.

532
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,810
-我昨晚才見過你  -那不算
- I saw you last night. - That didn't count.

533
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,990
在你跑回家
That was before you ran

534
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,360
洗泡泡浴並早早睡覺之前
home for a hot bubble bath and an early night.

535
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,950
是的 我不會再跑出去
Yeah, I don't get to stay out

536
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,260
刷夜狂歡了 再也不會了
to all hours just enjoying myself, any more.

537
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,760
這話你以前可沒少說
That never used to stop you.

538
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,760
我不是在幫桃麗絲說話
Not that I'm taking Doris's side,

539
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,690
可你為什麼不和傑克上床
but why didn't you have sex with Jake ?

540
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,690
他住在芝加哥 只是上床而已
He lives in Chicago. It would just be sex.

541
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,500
我想保持專注
I want to keep my focus clear.

542
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,380
眼下我不想把事情搞複雜
I don't want to complicate things right now.

543
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,640
複雜 但這不意味著你就該變成
Complicate. That doesn't mean you gotta turn

544
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,010
裏脊國的多米尼克修女
into Sister Dominic of the Tenderloin.

545
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,370
是了 這該是第二個窗的名字
That's it. That should be the name for the second window.

546
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,120
你在逗我嗎 你看他就這樣 帕特裏克
Are you kidding me? This is so what he's like, Patrick.

547
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,490
我就得面對這種人
This is what I have to deal with.

548
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,340
滿腦子只有工作
The only thing he ever thinks about is work.

549
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,900
這是壞事嗎
Is that so bad right now ?

550
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,230
我們只是想說人可以找點樂子
I think that all we're saying is it's ok to have a little fun.

551
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,590
-對  -用手去感觸人類的肌膚
- Yes. - Get your hands on some skin

552
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,430
而不是摸只禿毛雞
that doesn't belong to a plucked chicken.

553
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,150
聽著 謝謝關心
Ok, listen. I appreciate the concern, I do.

554
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,230
但我很好
but I'm fine.

555
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,130
我終於知道我想要什麼 更好的是
Finally, I know what it is that I want, and better still,

556
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,090
我知道怎麼去得到它 我有目標了
I can actually see a way of getting it. I got some purpose.

557
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,170
-性會帶來威脅嗎  -哪怕談戀愛也會嗎
- And sex could risk that? - Or maybe even a relationship?

558
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,530
很有可能
Very possibly.

559
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,000
我不... 老天...
I don't...god...I don't

560
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,330
我不想讓自己變成那種
I don't want to sound like some kind of one of those gross

561
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,330
-歌頌戀愛萬歲的人  -是
- couple relationship evangelist thing, - Yeah.

562
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,710
可你和林在一起時很開心
but you liked being with Lynn.

563
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,180
我確實很開心
Yes, of course I did.

564
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,550
可那不是我現在想要的
But that's not what I want right now.

565
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,310
我不想妥協
I don't want to compromise,

566
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,960
而感情會有很多妥協
and relationships take a lot of compromise.

567
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,300
-我能說句話嗎  -我說不能有用嗎
- Can I say one thing ? - Would it matter if I said no ?

568
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,640
木已成舟 而且效果不錯
This, this has happened, it's working.

569
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,810
不會弄巧成拙的
It's not something that gonna turn into shit.

570
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,970
好吧 相信我 我知道那種感覺
Alright. And believe me, I know the feeling.

571
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,070
但我不是我媽 你也不是你爸
But I'm not my mom and you're not your dad.

572
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,080
該死 對不起
Shit. Sorry.

573
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,210
我是... 隨便了
I'm being... whatever.

574
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,510
是 我可以
Yeah, I could do that.

575
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,270
對
Yes.

576
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,090
好的好的
Yes. Yes.

577
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,600
好 我們在那兒碰面
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

578
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,520
我現在過去找你
I will meet you there right now.

579
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,130
好的 馬上見
Okay. All right, I'll see you soon.

580
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,670
再見
Bye.

581
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,030
有人想和我一起去印第安巨岩嗎
Okay. Does anybody want to come with me to Indian Rock ?

582
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,700
奧古斯丁可能出了點狀況
I think that Agustin might be having a crisis.

583
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,150
我才不想
Fuck no.

584
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,100
-完全不想  -老天
- Not in a million years. - God.

585
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,490
-我得走了  -你自求多福吧
- I have to go. - You're on your own.

586
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,900
-祝我好運  -祝你好運
- Wish me luck. - Good luck.

587
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,380
就你身上這味道 一定能搞定他 再見
You're so gonna get laid smelling like that. Bye.

588
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,850
帕特裏克 我們又一起了
Good, Patrick, we're together again.

589
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,420
發生什麼了 你昨天看起來很冷靜
What happened? You seemed so calm yesterday.

590
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,500
我是很冷靜 但我今天早上
I was calm, and then I woke up this morning

591
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,050
胃疼疼醒的
with this pain in my stomach,

592
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,440
就像 有潰瘍要裂開的感覺
like, I had an ulcer that was about to burst.

593
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,390
因為結婚的壓力吧
It's a stressful thing you're doing getting married.

594
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,420
是吧
I guess.

595
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,880
你要對別人許下承諾
You're getting committed to somebody else.

596
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,610
這可是重大決定
It's a big thing.

597
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,940
你就別越描越黑了
I don't think your choice of vocabulary's helping.

598
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,990
-你愛他嗎  -我愛他嗎
- Do you love him? - Do I love him?

599
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,290
你愛埃迪嗎
Do you love Eddie?

600
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,900
我以前常說愛是一種並不存在的
I always used to say that love is a social construct（contract）

601
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,000
社會契約
that doesn't really exist.

602
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,130
我當時不信 現在也不信
I didn't believe you then and I don't believe you now.

603
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,160
-那你覺得它是什麼  -老天 別問我
- So, what is it? - Christ, don't ask me.

604
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,000
認真的 你怎麼定義它
Seriously, how would you define it ?

605
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,440
我換個問題吧
Let me ask a different question.

606
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,050
和埃迪在一起的想法讓你開心嗎
Does the idea of being with Eddie make you happy?

607
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,170
就比如 你們兩個會一起變老
Like, the two of you getting old and grey together,

608
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,760
一起抽大麻來緩解關節炎
smoking weed to ease the arthritis.

609
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,190
那樣的想法確實讓我開心
That thought does makes me happy.

610
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,160
為什麼
Why?

611
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,260
為什麼 我也不知道
Why? I don't know.

612
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,850
我喜歡他的鬍鬚 喜歡他收藏的帽子
I like his beard. I like his hat collection.

613
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,460
喜歡那種 不管我想吐槽誰
I like that whenever I have someone I wanna bitch about

614
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,320
或看見好玩的東西
or there's something funny that I see,

615
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,200
都想和他講的感覺
he's the person I want to tell.

616
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,980
他是我最好的朋友
He's my best friend, I guess.

617
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,300
我有點嫉妒 因為我不再是你最好的朋友了
I'm mildly jealous that I'm no longer your best friend.

618
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,460
好吧 他是我想上床的最好的朋友
Okay, he's my best friend that I wanna have sex with.

619
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,130
-而且 他有根大雞雞  -這不就夠了嗎
- Also, he has a huge penis. - Isn't that everything?

620
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,330
除了和雞巴有關的部分 我是說其他的
Not the penis part, obviously, but the other stuff?

621
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,960
如果你專注於那個
Maybe if you just focus on that,

622
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,370
壓力就不會那麼大了 對嗎
this won't seem like such a big deal. Right?

623
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,280
實際上 我覺得這跟埃迪沒關係
Actually, I don't even think this is about Eddie.

624
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,420
這也不像落跑新娘裏面的橋段
This isn't like some runaway bride moment

625
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,010
我也沒覺得還有別人更適合我
where I feel like there's someone else out there for me.

626
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,360
那是什麼
Then what is it?

627
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,700
你還記得上大學後 我們第一次來這嗎
Remember when we first came here after we started college?

628
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,540
-當然記得  -我們聊了遠大的人生計劃
- Of course. - We talked about our big life plan.

629
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,070
還有其他事
Among other things.

630
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,950
如果你那時候告訴我十年後
If you had told me then that a decade later

631
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,150
我會在藝術學院做店舖經理
I'd be working at the Art Institute as a shop manager

632
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,490
並且會和一個男人結婚 我...
and getting hitched to a man, I...

633
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,470
你那時候又知道什麼呢
What did you know about anything in those days ?

634
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,630
那時我們又不能結婚
We couldn't even get married back then.

635
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,410
你聽到他們昨晚說的話了
You heard those guys last night.

636
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,880
特別是弗蘭克 多姆 布拉迪
Frank, especially him. Dom. Brady.

637
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,320
不要聽布拉迪胡扯
Don't listen to anything Brady says.

638
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,290
他就像個沒人會去讀的人形博客
He's like a blog that nobody reads, but in human form.

639
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,500
但那些人說的對 我以前以為
But those guys were right. I used to think that

640
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,860
我會成為凱斯·哈林 或者羅伯特·梅普勒索一樣的人
I would be like Keith Haring, or Robert Mapplethorpe.

641
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,430
現實卻是 我成了尼爾·帕特裏克·哈里斯
But instead, I've become Neil Patrick Harris.

642
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,930
只是沒他那麼酷 因為我不會跳踢踏舞
Only not as cool, 'cause I can't tap dance.

643
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,910
-你可以學啊  -說真的 帕蒂
- You can learn. - I'm being serious, Patty.

644
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,280
我沒成為我想成為的那個人 讓我很難接受
I'm not who I thought I'd be, and it's tough for me to take.

645
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,120
我變成了多年來我最反感的那種人
I've become everything that I rallied against for years.

646
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,070
-徹頭徹尾  -你還可以改變啊
- Very loudly. - You're allowed to change.

647
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,350
特別是你找到了能幫你的東西
Especially when you've found something that works for you.

648
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,840
但要是我結婚後崩潰了呢
But what happens if I get married and I freak out?

649
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,700
不是埃迪的問題 是我自己的
Not about Eddie but about me.

650
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,720
這個全新的我和我想像中相差甚遠
What happens if I can't cope that this new me is so far

651
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,430
我應付不來怎麼辦 搞砸一切怎麼辦
from who I thought I would be that I fuck everything up?

652
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,350
傷了埃迪的心怎麼辦
What happens if I hurt Eddie?

653
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,610
我不想那樣對他
I don't want to do that to him.

654
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,980
我...我不能對他那樣
I...I can't do that to him.

655
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,130
為什麼你會覺得你會呢
What makes you think you'll do that ?

656
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,000
因為我就是這麼做的 他媽的
Because it's what I do, for fuck's sake.

657
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,850
沒過多久 我就會給CJ打電話
Before you know it, I'll be on the phone with CJ

658
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,570
帶上他和其他幾個男妓
and I'll get him and a couple of other rent boys

659
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,880
一起上埃迪 好讓我自在點
to fuck Eddie just so I could feel better about myself.

660
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,730
我可不信 你已經受過教訓了
I doubt that very much. I think you learned your lesson there.

661
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,620
是嗎
Did I?

662
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,130
你知道我愛什麼嗎
You know what I love?

663
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,670
過去的這些年
Over the last couple years,

664
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,670
當你發現有東西不適合你的時候
when you found that something didn't work for you,

665
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,470
你總有辦法解決
you somehow found a way to fix it.

666
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,850
而那讓你很開心 不是嗎
And that made you happy, right?

667
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,840
我想是的
I suppose.

668
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,210
你現在比過去的任何一天都開心
You are happier now than you've ever been.

669
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,490
顯然 除了現在
Not in this particular moment, obviously,

670
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,000
誰會在乎你是不是你18歲時
but who cares if you aren't you who thought you were gonna be

671
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,380
想變成的樣子呢
when you were eighteen years old.

672
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,130
你用十年時間
You have had ten years of experience

673
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,360
想清楚真正需要的東西
to figure out what it is you really need.

674
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,270
說得不錯
That's well said.

675
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,760
但你知道嗎
And you know what?

676
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,610
這不是凱瑟琳·海格爾的電影 去她媽的
This is not a Katherine Heigl movie. Fuck her.

677
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,120
這是你西格妮·韋弗的外星人三部曲
This is your Sigourney Weaver Alien trilogy.

678
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,790
你的路還長著呢
You've got so much left to go.

679
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,890
你甚至可以從頭開始藝術實踐
You could even start up your art practice again.

680
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,230
這有點嚇人了 比外星人還恐怖
Now that's a scary thought. Scarier than the alien.

681
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,770
確實 忽略我的玩笑話
That's true. Forget I said that last part,

682
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,400
但你知道我什麼意思
but you know what I mean.

683
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
我想你了
I miss you.

684
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,480
我也想你
I miss you, too.

685
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,120
我們就像是 孩子們都很好[音樂喜劇電影]裏的
We're just like Julianne Moore and Annette Benning

686
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,590
朱麗安·摩爾和安納·貝寧
in The Kids are All Right.

687
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,320
-真是這樣  -那我是哪個
- Totally. - Who am I?

688
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,240
安納·貝寧唄
Annette Benning, obviously.

689
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,890
你和他是炮友 不是嗎
You're sleeping with him, aren't you?

690
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,030
多姆 我要是16歲就出櫃
Dom, do you think things would have been different for me

691
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,650
一切會有不同嗎
if I came out when I was sixteen?

692
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,030
-怎麼不同  -我不知道 就是 不同唄
- Different how? - I don't know, just different.

693
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
更圓滑 就像那晚的吉米
More adjusted, like Jimmy from the other night,

694
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,470
或者更擅長經營感情
or better at being in relationships, maybe?

695
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,280
我以為你不想談戀愛
I thought you didn't want a relationship.

696
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,970
也許我只是自欺欺人
Maybe I was kidding myself just a little bit.

697
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,890
-至少你承認了  -所以 你想怎麼辦
- At least you admit it. - So, what do you think?

698
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,850
我也許不是聊感情最好的人選
I may not be the best person to ask about relationships,

699
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,460
畢竟我愛過一個癮君子
since my history is with a meth-head

700
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,380
愛過一個對死人念念不忘的老傢伙
and an old dude in love with a dead guy.

701
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,250
但也許沒必要考慮這些
But maybe it's not worth thinking about.

702
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,670
你回不到過去
You can't go back in time.

703
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,540
也許一切都會大不同吧
Maybe everything would've taken a very different turn

704
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,750
如果你那麼些年前就想把老二
if you had managed to shoehorn your dick into my butt

705
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,470
硬捅進我菊花的話
all those years ago.

706
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,130
天吶 你認真的
Oh, God. Seriously?

707
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,840
是啊 我就能更早克服肛交恐懼
Yeah. I would've gotten over my anal sex fear a lot earlier.

708
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,310
或許還有不少其他恐懼
Probably a lot of other fears, too.

709
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,450
記得電影2012嗎
Remember in the movie 2012

710
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,060
加州沉入太平洋
when California sank into the Pacific?

711
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,620
你不會真覺得會有那麼慘吧
You really think it would've been that bad?

712
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,230
我是啊 而且我們也不會成為最好的朋友
Yes. And plus we never would've become best friends,

713
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,850
那可太遺憾了
and that would've been a real shame.

714
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,680
對 我很高興你現在是我最好的朋友
That's true. I am glad that you're my best friend, now,

715
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,010
尤其是奧古斯汀走了之後
especially since Agustin's out of the picture.

716
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,100
所以 要是我們現在在一起會怎樣
So, what if we got together now?

717
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,370
當然了 我不想談戀愛
Sure. I don't want a relationship,

718
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,740
但如果是你 我願意破例
but for you, I'll make a exception.

719
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,870
得了吧 這又不是最餿的主意
Come on. It's not the worst idea in the world.

720
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,220
-看開點  -你剛說了我們是最好的朋友
- It's up there. - You just said we're best friends.

721
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,150
-對吧  -沒錯
- Right? - Yeah.

722
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,520
這可是一段戀愛完美的基礎
And that is the perfect basis for a relationship.

723
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,770
-誰說的  -奧古斯汀說的
- Says who? - Says Agustin.

724
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,220
他他媽的怎麼知道
What the hell does he know?

725
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,980
我的意思...
I mean...

726
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,490
我們沒有互相噁心
We don't make each other sick.

727
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,310
比如生理上 沒有吧
Like physically, right?

728
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,690
我噁心到你了嗎
Do I make you sick?

729
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,050
這得看我吃了些什麼
It depends on what I've eaten.

730
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,590
我不知道
I don't know, I mean,

731
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,240
說不定這關係一直擺在我們面前
maybe this has been staring us in the face the whole time.

732
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,390
你現在真嚇到我了
You are actually scaring me right now.

733
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,470
我們理解和包容著彼此
We understand and accept each other's flaws.

734
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,990
你的事業很重要 我的也是
Your work is important to you as mine is to me.

735
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,450
我們喜歡同樣的電影 理論上...
We like the same movies. On paper...

736
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,310
能不笑嗎 理論上 簡直天生一對
Would you stop laughing? On paper, it sounds totally right.

737
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,230
你不是認真的吧
You are not being serious.

738
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,090
-不是  -好 那就好
- Not really. - Okay, good.

739
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,630
但是這很好 不是嗎
But it would be nice, wouldn't it?

740
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,190
意外發現了很重要的東西
To suddenly find something by mistake that makes sense.

741
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:49,130
讓感情簡單了許多
That makes it all easier.

742
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,970
剛剛發什麼了什麼
What just happened?

743
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,400
-我吻了你  -為什麼
- I kissed you. - Why?

744
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,310
我不知道 就是想吻你
I don't know, I felt like it.

745
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
想看看你說的對不對
I wanted to see if you were right.

746
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,390
好吧
Okay.

747
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,270
你看起來是有點難過
And you looked a little sad.

748
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,730
-感覺怎樣  -有點怪 說實話
- How did it feel? - A little bit weird, if I'm honest.

749
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,140
-好像是在吻好兄弟是吧  -是啊 我的天
- Kind of like kissing your brother? - Yeah. Oh god.

750
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,040
真不敢相信我們接吻了
I can't believe we did that.

751
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,060
上帝啊
My god.

752
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,420
-我覺得我有點嗑嗨了  -我也是
- I think maybe I'm a little stoned. - Yeah, me, too.

753
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,510
我們該睡覺了
We should sleep.

754
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,380
很抱歉讓你跟我上床了
I'm sorry I made you make out with me.

755
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,120
你說了 你想給我找點樂子
You did say you wanted me to have some fun.

756
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,810
真是樂子啊
So fun.

757
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,180
再親一個
Go again?

758
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,440
天吶
God.

759
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,600
你做的對不對就難說了
So hard to know whether you're doing the right thing.

760
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,000
是啊
Yes.

761
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,010
所以 你的回答是
So, what's the answer?

762
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,050
誰他媽的知道呢
Who the fuck knows?

763
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,240
儘管 你今早也許是對的
Although, maybe you were right this morning.

764
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,820
-什麼對的  -和過去做了斷
- About what? - About closing a chapter.

765
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,370
過去太容易給現在造成麻煩
It's so easy to let the past make a mess of the present.

766
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,930
你該試著避免 僅供參考
You should try not to let that happen, just FYI.

767
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,150
這是個驚喜
This is a surprise.

768
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,710
-你染金髮了啊  -是啊 金髮了
- You're blonde. - Yeah, I'm blonde.

769
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,550
-還把頭髮剪了  -你看起來挺好的
- And you had your hair cut, too. - You look well.

770
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,230
沒必要穿正裝的
You didn't need to dress up.

771
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,350
其實是奧古斯汀今天結婚 所以...
Agustin's getting married, today, actually, so...

772
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,690
-和埃迪嗎  -是的
- To Eddie? - Yeah.

773
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,110
操 我都沒想到他們能長久了
Fuck. I never put money on that lasting.

774
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,310
我想 愛情是個神秘的遊戲
Love is a mysterious game, I guess.

775
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,030
是啊
Yeah.

776
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,700
-順便說一句 你看起來也很好  -謝謝
- You look well, too, by the way. - Thank you.

777
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,120
我們就這樣站在這
Should we just stand here

778
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,200
相互誇讚真的好嗎
and tell each other how well we look,

779
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,410
還是去喝杯咖啡
or should we go get that coffee

780
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,010
解釋一下為何給我發短信
and explain why you texted me?

781
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,650
走吧
Let's do that.

782
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,490
這邊吧
I'm thinking this way.

783
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,200
-行嗎  -好 走吧
- Cool? - Yes, let's do it.

784
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,070
好
Cool.

785
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,460
丹佛怎麼樣 我喜歡那裏的生活
So, how's Denver? I love what you guys are doing.

786
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,010
挺好的
It's good.

787
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,000
-是嗎  -是啊
-Yeah? -Yeah.

788
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,870
聽說你終於有了自己的圈子
I hear you're finally heading your own chain.

789
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,870
是好事
That's a good thing.

790
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,600
早該這樣了
That's something that should've happened a long time ago.

791
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,350
謝謝
Thanks.

792
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,880
一句建議 別愛上任何下屬
Word of advice. Don't go falling for any of your subordinates.

793
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,680
我盡力
I'll try my best.

794
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,020
MDG怎麼樣了 歐文呢 我最近都沒...
How's MDG? And Owen? I haven't really talk...

795
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,340
-和他聊過 我知道  -沒錯
-Talked to hem, I know. - Yeah.

796
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,540
他很好 升職了
He's good. He's been promoted.

797
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,550
梅雷迪斯 終於出櫃了
Meredith, she finally came out.

798
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,590
啥
What?

799
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,660
開玩笑的 過來
I'm kidding. Here.

800
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,560
謝謝
Thank you.

801
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,300
你看起來不一樣了 不是完全的不同 但...
You look different. Not completely different, but...

802
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,530
我減了幾斤 可能是因為這個吧
Well,I lost a little weight, maybe it's that, right?

803
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,780
也許吧 我體重漲了
Maybe. I've piled on the pounds.

804
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,290
約翰終於接受了我對炸雞的熱愛
John finally embraced my love of fried chicken.

805
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,770
-約翰  -對 我們復合了
- John? - Oh yeah, We got back together.

806
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,820
真的啊
Really?

807
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,750
讓你很吃驚嗎
Does that surprise you?

808
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,840
我不知道 應該沒有吧
I donno. Maybe not.

809
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,050
知道嗎 我們的事 很大程度上
Do you know what, in many ways, what happened between us

810
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,220
是件好事 分手...
was a good thing. The break-up...

811
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,560
-大杯濾式黑咖啡  -我的 謝謝
- The large, filtered, tall, black? - That's me. Thank you.

812
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,690
整件事讓我反思自己想要什麼
The whole thing has just made me think about what I wanted,

813
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,580
需要如何維持一段感情
what I needed in a relationship to make it work,

814
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,090
很多時候 我很感激你來到我的生活
so in many ways, I'm quite thankful that you came into my life

815
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,930
又毀掉一切 因為現在我過得好多了
and fucked it up 'cause it's better, now.

816
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,180
我不知道該怎麼回答
I don't really know how to answer that.

817
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,690
約翰和我真的非常好
John and me are actually, we're actually really good.

818
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,860
我們進行過一些心理治療 強烈推薦
We had some therapy, which I would highly recommend for you.

819
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,960
你不是第一個這麼說的
You're not the first person to suggest that.

820
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,680
不意外
Not surprising.

821
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,640
我們完全理解了彼此的所想所需
We came to fully understand our wants and our needs.

822
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,430
你在這待得太久
You've been here too long,

823
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,050
口音都有點像美國人了
you're even starting to sound like an American.

824
00:41:59,050 --> 00:41:59,740
是呢...
Yeah,well....

825
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,440
-大杯豆奶冰咖啡  -謝謝
- Large, soy milk iced coffee? - Thank you.

826
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,230
如果我在"菲力斯第一"遇到了克裏斯·普拉特
If I meet Chris Pratt down at Fitness First

827
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,220
我可以盡情地幫他打飛機
I can jerk him off to my heart's content

828
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,540
根本不會覺得有啥不妥
and that's completely fine.

829
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,040
真心為你和約翰感到高興 還有克裏斯·普拉特
I'm happy for you and John. And Chris Pratt.

830
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,960
我才不信
I don't a-hundred percent believe that.

831
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,750
不是 我...
No, I...

832
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,280
不是我想要你難過
It's not like I ever wanted you to be miserable.

833
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,690
很高興治療對你有用
I'm glad it worked out for you.

834
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,990
坐吧
Shall we sit?

835
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,100
好
Yeah.

836
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,050
其實 我想把那個應用的一切權利交給你
Basically, I want to hand over all rights to you for the app.

837
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,330
好吧 這種事不用當面說
Okay. We didn't need to meet for that.

838
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,790
我知道 但這樣好一點
I know, but it's better to do it like this.

839
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,410
我可以叫人起草合同 但我覺得...
I could have a guy draw up a document, but I feel like...

840
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,150
-萬一能賺大錢呢  -又不是"我的世界"
- What if it makes a fortune? - It's hardly Minecraft.

841
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,450
好吧 但也可能幫我們賺一點
Okay, but it could still end up making us some money.

842
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,570
老套陳舊的劣質品
Stereotyped, cliche-ridden dross.

843
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,400
也可以是我的個人最佳 有關係嗎
Or my personal favorite, what the fuck is the point?

844
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,520
你幹嘛要在意其他人的意見
Why do you read what people say?

845
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,390
-你不嗎  -要啊 但我不在乎
- Don't you? - Yeah, but I don't care.

846
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,570
不管怎樣 賺錢從來不是重點
Anyway, making money was never the point.

847
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,620
重點是啥
What was the point?

848
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,470
我只是...
I just...

849
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,170
我覺得繼續下去沒有意義
I feel like it doesn't make sense for us to do it anymore.

850
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:20,830
繼續一起做下去
Together.

851
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,280
-好吧 我要問你點事  -好的
- Okay, I'm gonna ask you something. - Okay.

852
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,250
你真愛過我嗎
Were you ever actually in love with me?

853
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,180
愛過 我覺得愛過
Yes, I think so.

854
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,070
我當然愛過我們一起...
I certainly loved the idea of us...

855
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,920
我本來能做到的 我本來可以的
'Cause I could've made it work. I could've.

856
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,880
我說想和你成為終生伴侶的時候 我是真心的
When I said I wanted to be monogamous with you, I meant it.

857
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,620
我不想讓你做出無法實現的承諾
I didn't want you to make a promise you couldn't keep.

858
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,780
滾你媽的 你怎麼知道我不能
Fuck you. How do you know I wouldn't keep it?

859
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,220
我們不是因為這件事分手的 只是不合適
That's not why we broke up, we just weren't right for each other.

860
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,820
-不是 你到底怎麼知道的  -我就是知道
- No, how do you know that? - I did, I do.

861
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,440
你試都沒試過 突然搬進來
You didn't even try, you moved in one day,

862
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,250
第二天又搬出去 連行李都沒拆
you moved out the next. You didn't even unpack.

863
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,820
我承認我處理得很糟 但我道過歉
I admit that I handled that horribly, but I apologized for that.

864
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,710
比起自欺欺人的堅持
Isn't it better to quit

865
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,490
難道不是放棄更好嗎
rather than drag out something that you know won't work?

866
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,590
總之 都是你的問題
In a nutshell, there's your problem.

867
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,350
-什麼是我的問題  -你 你 你...
- What is? - You you you ...

868
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,330
你放棄 逃離 從來不願承擔風險
You quit, you run away, you don't take risks, ever.

869
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,180
你在說什麼 我搬去和你住
What are you talking about, I moved in with you.

870
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,850
不對 帕特裏克 冒險是嘗試解決問題
No, no, Patrick, the risk would've been trying to make it work.

871
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,600
是竭盡全力維持感情
The risk would've been putting in hard graft to make it work.

872
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,030
我不想這麼賤 但你就是懦夫
I don't want to seem like a cunt, but you are a coward.

873
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,350
我覺得這麼說不公平 我當時沒法再信任你了
I don't think that's fair. I couldn't trust you, any more.

874
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,320
我不知道竭盡全力是指什麼
And I don't know what hard graft means,

875
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,610
但我覺得我根本不是懦夫
but I don't think I've been a coward, at all.

876
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,010
結果大相逕庭
I think the facts tell a very different story.

877
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,780
懦夫能搬去另一個城市 開始新工作
Would a coward have moved to a different city, a new job,

878
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,960
拋下所有人嗎
left everything behind?

879
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,950
你不過是回家罷了
You basically moved home.

880
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,670
你確定你沒有逃離 沒有搬走嗎
Are you sure you didn't run away, and not move away?

881
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,620
這是兩回事
They're two very different things.

882
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,480
接下來呢 帕特裏克·穆雷的下一步是什麼呢
What next? What next for Patrick Murray?

883
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,290
沒用的話 我賭一百萬
When that doesn't work out, I bet you a million dollars

884
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,000
你又會開始找另一件事
you're already looking for the next thing.

885
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:11,900
你就是
You are.

886
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,720
我瞭解你 只會逃離 就是懦夫
I know you. You run away and you are a coward.

887
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,670
和我在一起的時候是 和理查德在一起的時候也是
You were a coward with me, you were a coward with Richard.

888
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,210
-夠了...  -走在路上遇到了幾個坑
- Enough... - You come across a few potholes in the road,

889
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,350
你不會去嘗試通過
and instead of trying to navigate through it,

890
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:23,900
只會踩下剎車 開始大哭
you slam your brakes on, you start crying,

891
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,420
然後調頭
and you run the other direction.

892
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,730
我不是來這聽你罵我或互相傷害的
I did not come here to get nailed to the cross or to get us both upset.

893
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,240
那你為什麼來
So, why did you come here, then?

894
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,640
別用那個應用當借口
Honestly, and please, please don't use the app as an excuse.

895
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,380
我是來翻篇的
I came here to close a chapter.

896
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,360
看看我們能不能釋懷
To see if we could move forward from this.

897
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,320
成為朋友 你是這麼想的嗎
To become friends? Is that what you want?

898
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,380
很好 你怎麼不去我家
Cool, why don't you come over to my house,

899
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,470
我 你 還有約翰就能一起吃燒烤了
and then we can have a barbecue, me, you, and John?

900
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,310
你真的... 真的覺得
Did you... I mean, did you really think

901
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,440
你和我能做朋友
that you and me could ever be friends?

902
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,510
很不幸 不覺得
No, sadly.

903
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,250
抱歉 我真不想變成這樣
Sorry. I really didn't want it to be like this.

904
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,790
-我不該發短信  -你做得不錯
- I shouldn't have texted. - It's a good thing.

905
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,850
是該有個了斷
It needed to be done.

906
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,610
把合同寫好 我會簽的
Just draw the contract, I'll sign it.

907
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,320
仔細想想 可能對我來說也是好事
Thinking about it, it's probably the right thing for me, too.

908
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,050
凱文
Kevin,

909
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,650
你真的覺得我們本來能成
do you honestly think we would've worked?

910
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,300
至少我願意試一試
I'd like to have given it a try.

911
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,390
本來不想告訴你
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

912
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:13,370
但看樣子我要因為反攻賺大錢了...
but seeing as I'm gonna make a fortune off One Up Him...

913
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,180
告訴我什麼
Tell me what?

914
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,550
我知道這馬上有個工作崗位
I know of a job position coming up here,

915
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,480
很適合你 就在舊金山
that you'd be good for, in SF.

916
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,980
在MDG
At MDG?

917
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,060
-我不..  -別擔心 我不會在的
- I don't... - Don't worry, I'm not gonna be there.

918
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,710
我和約翰要搬去倫敦了
John and I are moving to London.

919
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,340
-真的嗎  -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

920
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,240
找到了工作 我也一直很想家
Got a job offer there, and I've been missing home a lot.

921
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,360
你要離開舊金山了
Are you done with San Francisco?

922
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,080
如果你感興趣的話
If that's something that you'd be interested in,

923
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,020
我會安排的
I can make it happen,

924
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,860
但我得警告你 歐文會討厭你
but I have to warn you: Owen will hate you.

925
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,140
但是 他也很想你回去 所以...
But, he will also love to have you back, so...

926
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,030
你為什麼要為我這麼做
Why would you do that for me?

927
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,450
說真的 經過了... 這一切
Seriously, after... everything.

928
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,620
因為 儘管有過這一切 帕特尼克 我只想要你開心
Because, despite everything, Patrick, I just want you to be happy.

929
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,750
為什麼
Why?

930
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,650
為什麼
Why?

931
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,920
因為我愛你
'Cause I love you.

932
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,350
聽著 別待在丹佛了 回來吧
Look, don't stay in Denver. Come back,

933
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,850
某些不斷搬家來逃避的人
and you can take that from someone who moves around constantly

934
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,830
會告訴你 那樣從來都沒用
to avoid dealing with things. It never works.

935
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
我想你已經明白了
But I think you know that already.

936
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,100
有興趣就給我發郵件 不用面談 行嗎
If you're interested, just email me. We don't need to talk, okay?

937
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,280
最後抱一次
One last hug?

938
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,660
糟了
Oh, shit.

939
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,550
抱歉遲到了 遇到點問題...
Sorry I'm late, there was trouble...

940
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,900
-你還好吧  -很好啊 你好嗎
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, are you good?

941
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,900
-我很好 別擔心  -埃迪呢
- Yeah, I'm good. Don't worry. - Where's Eddie?

942
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,010
他第十一次去上廁所了
He's using the toilet for the eleventh time.

943
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,050
我要和一位老太太結婚了
I'm getting married to an old lady.

944
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,810
他到底在哪
Where the fuck is he?

945
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,370
快點 不然要重新排隊了
Hurry up! We're gonna lose our spot in line.

946
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,160
簡直像市裏的每個蠢貨都要結婚一樣
It's like every fucker in the city's getting married.

947
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,110
我差點被蜂擁的伴娘們軋過去
I nearly got run over by a stampede of bride's maids.

948
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,150
我們為什麼沒伴娘啊
Why don't we have bride's maids?

949
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,250
-你有我們啊  -也對
- You have us. - Yeah

950
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,560
我是意大利人 我的天
I'm Italian, for Christ's sake.

951
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,270
這會成為
This is gonna be the

952
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,980
史上最小型的意大利婚禮
smallest Italian wedding in the history of time.

953
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,890
這只是登記 今晚還有聚會
This is just paperwork. We're gonna party tonight.

954
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,480
好吧 那我為什麼要穿這身
Yeah, then why am I wearing this?

955
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,660
為了... 穿什麼 你沒穿婚紗啊
Like... wearing what? You're not wearing a wedding dress.

956
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,920
說不定我應該穿
Maybe I should be.

957
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,160
說不定我們應該在教堂結婚
And maybe we should be getting married in a church,

958
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,800
感謝上帝賜予我們愛情
giving thanks to the great white man in the sky for our love.

959
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,020
我不是這個意思
That's not what I said.

960
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,330
我們不是為了別人才這麼做
We're not doing this for other people,

961
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,240
不是為了父母
we're not doing this for our parents,

962
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,650
不是為了不在意的人
we're not doing this for people we don't give fuck about.

963
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:41,860
是為了我們自己 我們都說過
we're doing this for us. That's what we discussed.

964
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,150
我媽不該在這兒嗎 不然為什麼結婚
Shouldn't my mother be here? Otherwise, why are we doing this?

965
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,050
我是說 這到底是什麼
I mean, what is this?

966
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,710
我的天 我們到底為什麼要這樣做
Oh, my god. Why are we doing this at all?

967
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,940
好了 我們至少先登記吧
Okay. Can we at least check in?

968
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,040
我又得去廁所了 這次不只是撒尿
I have to toilet again, and this time it's not pee-pee.

969
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,150
別了 忍忍行嗎 你括約肌發達得很
No no no, hold it in okay? You have a powerful sphincter.

970
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,130
別這樣 快來
Come on, bounce. All right.

971
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,460
樓上等你們
I'll meet you guys up there.

972
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,510
-傑克 你能跟媽媽視頻嗎  -好
- Jake, can we get mama on FaceTime? - Yes. Yes

973
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,360
我來搞定他
I got this.

974
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,640
我們得守住出口 埃迪跑起來可快了
We should man the exits. Eddie is surprisingly fast.

975
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,200
他不會逃婚吧
He's not gonna do that, is he?

976
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,150
看他眼神 有這個打算
He's had that look in his eyes before.

977
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,610
我想他應該能處理好的
I think's gonna figure it out.

978
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,450
-你去哪了  -沒去哪
- Where were you? - Nowhere.

979
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,540
-那怎麼看起來...  -挺好的
- So, why do you look so... - I look fine.

980
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,090
-不好 我要去尿尿  -真的
- Shit, I need to pee, now. - Really?

981
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,000
我也是
So do I.

982
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,860
怎麼 我是認真的
What? I really do.

983
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,850
好吧 你們去尿 我在上面等你們
Okay. When you guys pee, and I'll meet you up there.

984
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,490
-好  -好吧
- Yeah. - All right

985
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,740
依據加利佛尼亞州的法律
By the state of California,

986
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,120
我宣佈你們成為彼此終身伴侶
I pronounce you partners for life.

987
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,410
現在你們可以親吻對方了
Now, you may kiss.

988
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:45,900
真好
That's great.

989
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,790
您好 打擾了 我想下一對該輪到我們了
Hello. Sorry, I think that we're next.

990
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,570
-你是蘭金還是蘭懷斯  -不 不是我結婚
- Are you Rankin or Lanwise? - No, I'm not getting married.

991
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,480
是我朋友 他們馬上就到了 他們...
It's my friends, but they'll just be a minute. They're...

992
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,420
-婚前焦慮是嗎  -差不多吧
- Last minute nerves? - Something like that.

993
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,220
我見得多了 不擔心
It's very common. I wouldn't worry.

994
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,890
那一對在一起四十五年了
Those two have been together for 45 years.

995
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,150
-真好  -可不是嘛
- That's amazing. - Yes, it is.

996
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,150
-我能問您個問題嗎  -當然
- Can I ask you something? - Of course.

997
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,640
您做這行多久了
How long have you been doing this?

998
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,760
挺久了 或者說太久了
A very long time. Some people would say too long.

999
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:37,690
那...
And...

1000
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,300
您能看出來兩個人能不能成嗎
are you able to tell if it's gonna work or not?

1001
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,980
有時吧 不過我倒是能看出哪個更想結婚
Sometimes, maybe I can tell who wants it more than the other one,

1002
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,360
-好吧  -或者...
- Yeah. - Or... you know.

1003
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,290
誰是認真的 誰還沒定下心來
Who's gotten real and who's head is still in the clouds.

1004
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:54,820
哪個願意去適應對方
Who's willing or unwilling to adapt.

1005
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,360
那麼
And,

1006
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,990
依您看 真的有人會為彼此而改變嗎
do you really think that people can change for each other?

1007
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,630
我覺得是適應對方而非改變彼此 這更實際一點
I prefer adapt to change. It's a little more realistic.

1008
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:12,040
再者 我看過一種觀點 我們展現出來的每種新面貌
Plus I read somewhere that every part of us has something to do

1009
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,760
都與之前的面貌相關
with the part that came before. Every new part is.

1010
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,070
老生常談吧
Does that sound corny?

1011
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,540
至少...我覺得很受用
It's... well, works for me.

1012
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,580
可能這就是我們在戀愛中不斷犯同樣錯誤的原因
Maybe that's why we keep making the same mistakes.

1013
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,340
或許吧
Probably.

1014
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,730
您結婚多久了
How long have you been married?

1015
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,050
這話我只跟你說 我沒結婚
Between you and me, not married.

1016
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,150
可你戴著戒指啊
But, your ring.

1017
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,290
就是個幌子 沒人想在健身房裏找個胖子[牧師]做教練
It's a prop. Nobody wants a fat trainer at the gym.

1018
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:37,470
明白我意思吧
You know what I mean.

1019
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,300
-還好嗎 準備好了嗎  -是
- You okay? You all set? - Yes.

1020
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,050
-蘭懷斯  -搞定了
- Lanwise? - I got it.

1021
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,510
這是我媽
Oh, it's my mom.

1022
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,500
-打個招呼吧  -媽媽好啊
- Say hi. - Hi mama. Hi!

1023
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,360
抱歉 我們可能還要點時間
I'm sorry I think we'll just be one more minute.

1024
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,900
-沒關係 別著急  -謝謝 萬分感激
- Sure. Take your time. - Thank you for it. Appreciate it.

1025
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,990
沒事了嗎
Is everything all right?

1026
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,860
-現在沒事了  -你跟他說什麼了
- It is, now. - What'd you say?

1027
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,590
這麼說吧 他是西格尼·韋弗的死忠粉
Let's just say he's a big Sigourney Weaver fan,

1028
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,630
多謝你爭取時間
so thank you for that.

1029
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,920
能幫上忙就好啦 損友伴娘就是幹這個的
It was my pleasure. That's what maids of dishonor are for.

1030
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,250
我只是希望 這場婚姻能如我們所願
I just hope that this marriage can be whatever we want it to be.

1031
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,390
會的 又不是要你們突然變專一
Exactly. It's not like you're just gonna suddenly be monogamous

1032
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,260
搬到郊區
and move to the suburbs.

1033
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,050
確實
No.

1034
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,900
而且我們兩個都深愛對方
And then, I love him, and he loves me,

1035
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,160
能壞到哪去呢
so what's the worst that could happen?

1036
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,920
也不過是沒成 但至少努力過了
It doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but, at least we tried.

1037
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,140
是啊
Yeah.

1038
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,510
我們開始吧
Let's fuckin' do this.

1039
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,090
你準備好了吧
Yeah. You got it all done, right?

1040
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,360
好極了 你們看著那裏
Great, perfect, and if you would just take a look at that

1041
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,530
確保說出自己所有的心裏話
and make sure they're saying everything they want to say.

1042
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,650
愛德華 你選擇了奧古斯丁為終身伴侶
Edward, you have chosen Agustin to be your partner in life.

1043
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,110
你願意永遠愛他 尊重他
Will you strive to love and respect him always,

1044
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,600
不論何事發生都坦誠相待並支持他嗎
be honest and kind and stand by him, whatever may come?

1045
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,150
我願意
I do.

1046
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,550
奧古斯丁 你選擇了愛德華為終身伴侶
Agustin, you've chosen Edward to be your partner in life.

1047
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,030
你願意永遠愛他 尊重他
Will you strive to love and respect him always,

1048
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,520
不論何事發生都坦誠相待並支持他嗎
be honest and kind and stand by him, whatever may come?

1049
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,170
我願意
I do. Yes.

1050
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,740
你們承諾會在生活和工作中
And do you both promise to make the necessary adjustments

1051
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,670
適當調整步伐
in your personal and professional lives

1052
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,980
來維持婚姻關係和諧穩定嗎
in order that you may live in a harmonious relationship together?

1053
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,630
我們願意
We do.

1054
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:18,420
愛德華 奧古斯丁
And as much as you, Edward, and you, Agustin,

1055
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,430
你們已經在親友的見證下承諾了對彼此的愛
have pledged your love to each other in front of these witnesses,

1056
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,970
根據加利福尼亞州賦予我的權力
by the power vested in me by the state of California,

1057
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,680
我宣佈你們結為連理
I pronounce you partners in life.

1058
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,680
現在可以親吻對方了
Now you may kiss.

1059
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,310
天哪
My god.

1060
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,190
現在幹嘛
Now what?

1061
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,260
現在我們去喝個痛快 嗑藥狂嗨
Now we get drunk and we take a lot of fuckin' drugs.

1062
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,360
抱歉啦 媽媽
Sorry, mom.

1063
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,230
嗨 怎麼樣了
Hey, there. How'd it go?

1064
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,210
很溫馨
It was really sweet.

1065
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,750
奧古斯丁沒緊張嗎
Agustin didn't freak out?

1066
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,240
他昨天有點 不過今天倒是埃迪慌了
Yesterday, but not today. Eddie, though, that was a close call.

1067
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,490
-真的  -是啊
- Really? -Yeah.

1068
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,620
我們太容易對這一切習以為常了
It's so easy to disregard all of this, all this like

1069
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,810
就如我們能結婚來講 還有結婚意味著什麼
being able to get married stuff, and what it means,

1070
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,110
可我們今天在市政廳 在公開場合
but when we were in city hall, today, in public,

1071
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,790
在陌生人面前
in front of total strangers,

1072
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:46,560
我不知道該怎麼形容 也許過幾年
I don't know,in a few years,

1073
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,460
人們會認為這很正常 對吧
this is all just gonna be normal, right?

1074
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,920
只是一種生活方式 沒什麼大不了
It'll just be a way of life and that's great,

1075
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,260
但是現在對於我們
but now for us,

1076
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,540
還有比我們早出櫃的人
and for all those people that came before us,

1077
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,160
不得不為自己抗爭的人來說
that actually had to struggle against something,

1078
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,660
這一切都太他媽難以置信了 不是嗎
it's just pretty fucking incredible, right?

1079
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,650
確實
It is.

1080
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,260
你自然而然地就會覺得
And you can't help but feel,

1081
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,100
怎麼說 被法律認可了
I don't know, validated,

1082
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,410
即便我知道我們不需要
even though I know we shouldn't need that validation.

1083
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,540
我想 你覺得自己不需要
I guess just because you feel you shouldn't need something,

1084
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,390
並不意味著你真的不需要
doesn't mean you don't.

1085
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,940
嗨 小帕餅
Hi, Paddy-cakes.

1086
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,360
-抱歉沒給你拿喝的  -沒關係
- Sorry I didn't get you one. - It's okay.

1087
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,460
你們剛才在聊什麼
What are we talking about?

1088
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,130
就是覺得他們能結婚是件很棒的事
Just how great it is. Them getting married.

1089
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,590
-來杯香檳嗎  -好
- Champagne, yeah? - Yeah!

1090
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,000
麻煩給我來杯龍舌蘭 謝謝
Could I please get a tequila? Thank you.

1091
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,860
-你見到多姆了嗎  -他就在這附近吧
- Have you seen Dom? - He's around here somewhere.

1092
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,300
我已經找了一圈了...
I've already made a round of...

1093
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,570
天哪 我太瞭解你這幅表情了
Oh, god, I so know that look.

1094
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,560
結婚太糟糕了吧 太可怕了
Weddings are awful, aren't they? They're horrible.

1095
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,510
想想他們最後肯定要離婚
You have to take solace

1096
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,260
你就沒那麼難受了
in knowing that it's gonna end in divorce.

1097
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,030
我保證
Guaranteed.

1098
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,240
-馬利克玩得挺開心啊  -就是說啊
- Malik seems to be enjoying himself. - I know!

1099
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,570
他在和一群胖熊跳舞 糟了
He's dancing with a bunch of bears. Oh no.

1100
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,600
我是不是該擔心了 他看上去挺高興的
Should I be worried? It looks like he's having fun.

1101
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,070
你確定你不想要用結婚戒指把他綁住嗎
Are you sure you don't wanna lock that down with a wedding ring?

1102
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,090
他真的挺不錯的
It's total a beef cake.

1103
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,870
天哪 別扯了 結婚戒指屁用也沒有 小孩嘛就另當別論了
Oh,god. Wedding rings don't do shit. Babies, on the other hand,

1104
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,390
你總不能把小孩子從馬桶衝下去 你得...
so much harder to flush down the toilet, you gotta really like...

1105
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,620
-你說什麼  -想點辦法
- What? - ...work out.

1106
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:31,110
什麼 什麼也沒說 天哪 我喝大了 我剛才說什麼了
What? What? Oh my god, what? I'm so drunk, y'all. What'd I say?

1107
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,240
-天 你是...  -別說了 我沒有...
- Oh, my god, are you... - No ! I'm not...

1108
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,970
你覺得我懷孕了嗎 沒 我沒有
You think I'm pregnant? No, I'm not.

1109
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,550
我要是有了就不會喝酒了
I wouldn't be drinking if I was.

1110
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,130
我媽懷我的時倒是照喝不誤
If I was my mother I would be.

1111
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,110
天哪 你真懷了 是不是
Oh my gosh, you are, aren't you?

1112
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,160
我沒懷 好嗎
No, I'm not, okay?

1113
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,200
敗給你了 基佬版福爾摩斯
But, okay, Sherlock Homo.

1114
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,290
你得...馬利克和我是打算要一個孩子
You got... Malik and me we're talking about having a baby.

1115
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,340
多麗絲 太好了
Doris, this is incredible news !

1116
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,770
-是嗎  -當然是啊
- Oh, god, is it? - Yeah !

1117
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,750
你不覺得我是人老珠黃
You don't think I'm this big,

1118
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,330
才要孩子 太晚了嗎
old cliche who has incredible news?

1119
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:58,920
怎麼會呢 如果你想要孩子
Cliche? No. If you wanna have a baby,

1120
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,320
就去爭取 懂嗎
you wanna have a baby, right?

1121
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,200
-我想是吧  -天 這事多姆知道嗎
- Yeah, I guess. - Oh my god, does Dom know?

1122
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:07,370
不知道 我打算昨天說的
No, I was gonna tell him yesterday,

1123
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,350
被你給毀了
but then you ruined it.

1124
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,080
-天哪  -得再找個機會...天啊
-Oh my god... - Get a second... oh god!

1125
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,130
-現在就跟他說啊 快  -不要
- Tell him now! Tell him! -No!

1126
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,940
好吧 別太認真 你真是...
Shit, take it easy. You're making...

1127
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,980
我...沒什麼 只是...
I've... I... nothing, just...

1128
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,440
馬利克和我打算要一個孩子...
Malik and me are talking about having a baby...

1129
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,550
真的
What?!

1130
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,950
我可能懷不上 因為我年紀大了
I may not even be able to have one, 'cause I'm old.

1131
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,250
-我可能就是鹽堿地了  -你是在逗我嗎
- There's gonna be sand pouring out of me. - Are you kidding me?

1132
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,110
如果有的話 他肯定是胸毛長大齙牙
And if we have one, it's gonna a have this weird chest hair and overbite.

1133
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:28,050
你在說笑嗎
Are you kidding me?

1134
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,250
沒 沒開玩笑 我們正在聊這個
No, I'm not kidding you. We are talking about it.

1135
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,350
好吧
Okay.

1136
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,610
-不幸的是 這不...  -我... 我無法...
- Unfortunately, it's not... - Wow, I... I can't...

1137
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,590
-我要做叔叔了嗎  -是的 你能當個基叔叔
- I'm gonna be an uncle? - Yep. You can be an guncle.

1138
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:40,790
你怎麼都沒告訴我
Why didn't you tell me?

1139
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,550
-我不知道 只是...  -你為什麼不告訴我
- I don't know, just... - Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1140
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:48,020
因為我以為 我要是有孩子
because I thought that if I was gonna have a baby

1141
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,150
我會跟你生
I thought I was gonna have one with you,

1142
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,970
但我又不會跟你有孩子
and I'm not going to be having one with you.

1143
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,210
-別擔心  -我知道 只是太...
- Don't worry. - I know, it's just so...

1144
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,090
這樣好棒啊 太棒了
It's so much better! So much better!

1145
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,100
你吐沫染了我一身
You're spilling your beer all over me, too.

1146
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,550
-抱歉 抱歉  -沒事
- Sorry, sorry. - It's ok.

1147
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:10,000
-太他媽屌了  -奇跡般的生命啊
- That's just fucking amazing. - Yeah, oh, the miracle of life.

1148
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,560
我不會結婚的 所以別提這事
I'm not gonna get married. So don't bring that up.

1149
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,880
這是個私生子
It's gonna be a bastard child.

1150
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,570
我們就想這樣 而且老天爺啊
That's what we want, and for god's sakes,

1151
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,710
讓他也變彎吧 我想要個彎寶寶
please let it be a gay baby. I want a gay baby.

1152
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,910
有你做媽 那個小傢伙真是上輩子造了孽
With you as its mother, the poor fuck doesn't have a choice.

1153
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,140
我知道
I know.

1154
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:25,890
但在我毀了自己生活之前 我今晚想磕點藥
But before I ruin my life, I wanna do some drugs tonight.

1155
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,920
假裝我們還25歲
Pretend we're 25.

1156
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,710
沒錯 帥傑克有藥呢
Fuck yes. Handsome Jake has some moon-rocks.

1157
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,660
帥傑克
Handsome Jake?

1158
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,910
可以說是帥傑克喚醒了我的決心
Handsome Jake is kind of weakening my resolve.

1159
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,500
今晚有點小轉變了哦
This evening is going to take a little turn.

1160
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,340
我本以為會很糟呢
I thought it was gonna be a nightmare.

1161
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,260
太棒了 好吧 快來
Wonderful, all right. Let's do it.

1162
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,560
一起來吧
Let's do it.

1163
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:50,020
你現在的這種感覺不會持續很久
This does not last forever. This feeling you're having.

1164
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,620
我非常清楚你的感受
I know exactly what you're feeling.

1165
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,300
這些慘事都會過去的
This whole misery thing it passes, it does.

1166
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,210
如果你想 它就會過去的 好嗎
If you want it to, it will, okay?

1167
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,660
改天聊
I'll talk to you later.

1168
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,130
小帕
Paddy!

1169
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,840
-我能插進來嗎  -好啊
- Can I cut in? - Yeah.

1170
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:21,300
我們該每天都告訴我們的孩子 他們很漂亮
We need to tell our kids every day that they are beautiful,

1171
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:25,860
他們的生命富有意義 健康幸福 安全和被愛
that their lives do matter, that they deserve to be healthy

1172
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,010
都是他們應得的
and happy and safe and loved.

1173
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,760
埃迪就是那樣做的
That's what Eddie does.

1174
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,570
每天他去工作時 他都會那樣做
Eddie does that every day when he goes to work.

1175
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,050
這就是我愛你的原因 埃迪
And that's why I love you, Eddie,

1176
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:38,630
我為你驕傲 很高興你找到了另一半
I'm proud of you, I'm so happy that you found a man.

1177
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,740
感謝你邀請我今晚來見證這一切
And thank you for inviting me to be a part of this, tonight.

1178
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,430
那麼 "損友伴娘"們在哪呢
Now where are those maids of dishonor?

1179
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,950
帕特裏克 快滾上來
Patrick, get your skinny ass up here.

1180
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,980
好吧
Okay.

1181
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,230
好吧 美人們 開始了
Okay, you beautiful boys, here we go.

1182
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,590
我想在場的所有人都同意
I think everybody in this room can agree

1183
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:09,600
結婚是世界上最讓人驚訝的事
that this is the most surprising thing in the world,

1184
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,760
但同時 它又完全有道理 對嗎
but, at the same time, it makes total sense, am I right?

1185
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,280
我們愛你 小帕
We love you, Paddy.

1186
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,450
這跟我無關 我不會對自己說這些
This isn't about me, I'm not gonna make this speech about me.

1187
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,910
你就是主角
Never gonna happen.

1188
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,940
我想說說奧古斯丁
I want to talk about Agustin.

1189
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,290
我們是多年老友了
We have been friends for a very long time.

1190
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:31,240
我有無數個愛你的理由
And there are a million reasons why I love you.

1191
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,810
但其中最重要的原因
But one of them, one of the biggest ones,

1192
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:38,380
是你總是不遺餘力地好好生活
is that you have been always incredibly committed

1193
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,220
這點真是不可思議
to making the most of your life.

1194
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,300
哪怕你搞砸了 我們都經歷過了 不是嗎
And even when you fuck up, and we all fuck up, right?

1195
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,670
是的 我們都搞砸過
Yes, we all fuck up.

1196
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,000
就算你拿不準 也還是繼續前行
You keep going despite any sort of doubts that you might have,

1197
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,830
你一直努力尋找適合自己的東西
and you keep trying to find the things that work for you,

1198
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:58,400
你也找到了埃迪 不是嗎
and you found Eddie, right?

1199
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:01,670
沒錯 顯而易見的是
And... yes. And it is really clear

1200
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,140
你們倆深愛著對方
that you two are absolutely crazy about each other,

1201
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,790
同時 又很清楚的明白
while at the same time being incredibly realistic

1202
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,270
婚姻意味著什麼
about what that means,

1203
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,540
而且雙方都致力於
and, and both being really committed

1204
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:16,100
找到婚姻維持之道
to figuring out how to make that work.

1205
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,310
是的
Yes.

1206
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,470
我...
And I...

1207
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,720
我覺得那真是...
I just think that that is...

1208
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,060
太棒了 趁我我開始大哭之前
Amazing! And so, before I start openly weeping,

1209
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,640
讓我們舉杯祝賀奧古斯丁和埃迪吧
let's raise a cheap cocktail to Agustin and Eddie!

1210
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,120
敬埃迪和奧古斯丁
To Eddie and Agustin!

1211
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,190
都敬 現在 各位 請歡迎
That too. And now, everybody, please welcome to the stage

1212
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,880
我的搭伴"損友伴娘" 傑克
my fellow maid of dishonor, Jake.

1213
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,360
帕特裏克 謝謝你 說得真好
Patrick, thank you, that was beautiful.

1214
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,720
借過
Excuse me.

1215
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,610
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

1216
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,060
比上次說得好
Better speech than last time.

1217
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,230
上次真是糟透了 不是嗎
Couldn't really have been any worse, right?

1218
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,820
或許吧
No, probably not.

1219
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,380
我要再喝一杯
I need another drink.

1220
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,010
你能給我買一杯嗎 我沒有現金了
Will you buy me another drink? I don't have any cash left.

1221
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,350
你還沒喝夠嗎
You don't think you've had enough?

1222
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,890
得了吧
Oh, come on.

1223
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,210
盛大的同志婚禮呢 是不是 我想一醉方休
Big gay wedding, right? I want to get super drunk

1224
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,270
這樣我就能忘掉我們倆最近有多沉悶了
so I can forget about how dull we've all become.

1225
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:24,190
你不是已經喝高了嗎
Aren't you already super drunk?

1226
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,550
別跟老太婆一樣嘮叨好嗎
Less of the nagging fifties housewife, please, okay?

1227
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,850
我們可沒結婚
We aren't married.

1228
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:32,440
我總覺得你會是妻子 你穿圍裙很好看
I always thought you'd be the wife. You look so good in an apron.

1229
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:34,360
說什麼呢
What was that?

1230
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:40,050
開個玩笑而已 你說他是個嘮叨的老婆 我就...
It was just a joke. You called him a nagging wife and I...

1231
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,910
你希望我像個妻子
You'd expect me to be the wife.

1232
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,810
-佈雷迪...  -隻是個玩笑
- Brady... - It was just a joke, that's all.

1233
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,400
你的恐女癥也突然間成了笑話了嗎
Is your fem-phobia a joke all of a sudden ?

1234
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,870
-佈雷迪...  -什麼 我在講笑啊
- Brady... - What, I'm kidding.

1235
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,530
不 沒事的 隨你說吧
No, that's okay, you can say it.

1236
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,620
這也不是頭一次
It's not the first time you've implied

1237
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:54,150
你暗示我是同志社群的奇葩了
I'm everything that's wrong with the gay community.

1238
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,530
我說你跟凱文是 不是說你
I said you and Kevin were, not you.

1239
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:01,470
-在聊什麼呢  -說帕特裏克就是個害群之基
- What are we talking about ? - About Patrick being a shitty gay.

1240
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:05,740
我很喜歡同志們互相爭論做同志這件事
I love it when gays argue with other gays about being gays.

1241
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,170
佈雷迪覺得他是同志領袖
Brady thinks he's grand minister of queer.

1242
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,330
同志思想糾察隊的領導
The leader of the gay thought police.

1243
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,600
這叫有思想會思考
It's called having a brain and think about things.

1244
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,040
抱歉啊 我有些原則...
Sorry I want to stipulate a little...

1245
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,260
你們倆夠了
Both of you, enough.

1246
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,290
佈雷迪有時候會覺得 做同志只有一種方式
It's a little frustrating that sometimes Brady thinks

1247
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,010
也就是他的那種 煩死了
there's only one way to be gay, and that way is his way.

1248
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,770
我只是很討厭 像你這樣敗壞同志名聲的人 好嗎
I'm just sick of people like you giving us a bad name, okay?

1249
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,530
如果真有"我們"
You would think that if there was such a thing as us,

1250
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,260
就會多一點團結感
there would be a little more solidarity.

1251
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,660
-也許你沒那資格  -佈雷迪 說真的
- Maybe you don't deserve it. - Brady, seriously,

1252
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,760
-說什麼呢  -我永遠都不能理解
- what the fuck? - I will never understand

1253
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,120
你為什麼那麼擠兌我
why you're so intent on making me feel bad,

1254
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,950
就因為我不能符合你的理想標準嗎
because I can't live up to some ideal

1255
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,810
可我永遠不會招辦的 那根本不是我
that I'll never live up to because it just isn't who I am.

1256
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:41,800
如果你不高興 那不一定是我的問題
If you feel bad, it's probably not my fault.

1257
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,430
-夠了 好嗎  -對不起 裏奇 你說得對
- Enough. Okay? - I'm sorry, Richie, you're right.

1258
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,780
佈雷迪 我道歉
Brady, I apologize.

1259
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,530
我保證多看你的文章
And I promise to read more of your articles,

1260
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:53,020
希望某天我能最終學會如何做同志
and hope that one day I can finally learn how to be gay

1261
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,910
然後完全符合你的標準
and be as perfectly adjusted as you.

1262
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,310
-是啊 滾你媽的  -滾你媽才對
- Yeah, fuck you. - Fuck you back!

1263
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,700
就這樣吧 我們走了
That's it, we're out of here.

1264
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,340
-你為什麼幫他  -我沒啊
- Why are you taking his side? - I'm not.

1265
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,490
為什麼感覺像你在幫他
Why does it feel like you are?

1266
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,690
這跟幫誰無關
This has nothing to do with sides.

1267
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,350
那跟什麼有關
Then what is it about?

1268
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,440
跟你喝多了有關
This is about you being too drunk,

1269
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,170
這是祝賀埃迪跟奧古斯丁的派對
and this is a party for Eddie and Agustin,

1270
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,620
和你怎麼看待帕特裏克無關
and has nothing to do with how you feel about Patrick.

1271
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,320
這麼說來 或者是他怎樣看你
Or how he feels about you for that matter.

1272
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,360
真是典型啊 你會幫他...
Typical that you would take his...

1273
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,300
你想跟他在一起嗎
You want to be with him?

1274
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,980
是這回事嗎
Is that what this is?

1275
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,210
在他甩你之後
After all the shit he's put you through?

1276
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,540
好吧 我們要走了
Ok, you know what, we're out of here.

1277
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,090
我打保票
Because I can guarantee

1278
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:30,070
他還會再傷你的心
he will do nothing but break your heart again.

1279
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,030
那就是你計劃的嗎
That your plan?

1280
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,610
你想坐著私人飛機空降回來
You want to fly in here on your private jet

1281
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,970
偷走我的男朋友嗎
and steal my fucking boyfriend?

1282
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,600
當然不是
Of course not.

1283
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,710
快他媽走吧
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1284
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,960
你不走了 是不是
You're not gonna come, are you?

1285
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:56,310
來吧 我們走
Come on, let's go.

1286
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,490
-你還好嗎 兄弟  -他吃醋而已
- You okay, bud? - He's just jealous.

1287
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,360
什麼
What?

1288
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,100
誰都看得出來你們倆之間有事
Everyone can see there's something between you guys.

1289
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,890
我們之間很清白
There's nothing between us.

1290
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,150
但我又搞得他難做人
Yet I have managed to fuck things up for him again.

1291
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,780
那完全不是你的錯
That was totally not your fault.

1292
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,750
早知道我他媽就閉嘴了
I could've just shut the fuck up.

1293
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,360
我怎麼就一直他媽關不住我這嘴
Why can't I ever shut the fuck up.

1294
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,670
嘿 姐們 你沒事吧
Shit, girl, you all right?

1295
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,670
剛說了啥 你有私人飛機
What is that? You have a private jet?

1296
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,360
你要是有私人飛機咋看起來還這麼窮
How come you're so fuckin' cheap if you have a private jet?

1297
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,260
這是嚴肅的問題
That's a legitimate question.

1298
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,460
好了 別說了
All right. Let's just stop this, OK?

1299
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,070
我不想毀掉大家的週末
I didn't come here to just ruin everybody's weekend.

1300
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:26,660
-你這麼說只是...  -我們能不能...
- You only say that... - Can we just...

1301
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,840
-去跳舞吧  -好
- Can we please just dance? - Yeah.

1302
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:31,470
-我們去舞池跳舞吧  -好
- Let's just all get on the dance floor and dance. - OK.

1303
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:33,830
走咯
Let's do it!

1304
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,480
他媽的
Fuck.

1305
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,900
-我應該告訴的你  -啥事
- I should tell you something.- What?

1306
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,060
我打算離開舊金山
I'm thinking about leaving San Francisco.

1307
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,550
幾個意思
What do you mean?

1308
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,570
我已經考慮了好久
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

1309
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,680
佈雷迪和我都商量過
Me and Brady were even talking about it.

1310
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,870
你是說離開了就不回來了嗎
You mean like actually leaving, like, for good?

1311
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,960
你就做到了 你有膽量做到
You did it. You had the guts to do it.

1312
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,070
對 可我只是為了逃避
Yeah, but I think I was just running away.

1313
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,700
所以呢
Who cares?

1314
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,620
有些時候 逃避才是最好的方法
Sometimes, running away is exactly what you need to do.

1315
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,950
可你在這裏出生
But you were born here.

1316
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,220
這是你的家 你永遠屬於這裏
This is your home, you've always been here.

1317
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:31,260
正因如此 大家都到這裏來
Exactly. Everyone else gets to come here.

1318
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:32,860
重新開始 而我...
And starting new. I...

1319
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,920
-我從來沒有經歷過  -那你會去哪
- I never had that. - Where you gonna go?

1320
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,100
我有親人在德州
I have some family in Texas.

1321
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,770
你去德州能幹嘛
What are you gonna do in Texas?

1322
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,320
我可以運貨 可以工作
I could take the truck. I can work.

1323
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:47,400
至少在那 我可以做些除了等死 當個嬉皮士外
At least there I might get to do more than just fades

1324
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,250
更有意義的事
and hipster bullshit.

1325
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,910
那你最好不要去奧斯汀
Better not go to Austin, then.

1326
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:58,850
真諷刺 你竟然要離開
It's funny or ironic, that you're thinking about leaving,

1327
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:03,720
因為... 就在今天
because... just today,

1328
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,580
我得到了一份回來工作的機會
I was offered a job back here.

1329
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,350
-我去  -怎麼了
- Shit! - What?

1330
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,050
-我不想你這麼做  -怎麼了
- I don't want you to do that. - What?

1331
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,460
回到這個鬼地方
Come back here.

1332
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,400
我必須離開
I need to do this

1333
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,910
我不想因為這些誘惑而留下來
and I don't need the temptation to stay.

1334
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:30,240
我必須保持頭腦清晰
I gotta get my head straight,

1335
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,970
因為我腦子有點暈
'cause right now it's all over the fucking place.

1336
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,730
有太多的東西要我理清了
And there's so much that I need to sort out.

1337
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,640
比如說
Like what?

1338
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,050
我與一個我不愛的人
I've been in a relationship for a year

1339
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:44,530
交往了一年
with a guy that I wasn't in love with.

1340
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:50,410
現在我最好還是一個人好好靜靜
I think right now, I just need to be alone.

1341
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,590
我明白 我... 我...
I get that. I... I...

1342
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:57,360
我很明白 我知道你非常希望獨身一人
I totally get that. I get your desire to be alone.

1343
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:01,230
我這九個月來就為了這個
That's what I've just done for the last nine months.

1344
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,250
同時
But at the same time,

1345
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,310
自從回到這裏 我才意識到
being back here, I've realized that

1346
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,370
單身並不是本該有的樣子
being alone isn't all it's cracked up to be.

1347
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,400
是的...
Yeah, well...

1348
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,640
-我們不一樣  -可我們差別也沒那麼大
- We aren't the same person. - We're not that different either.

1349
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,020
你就不想在你一天忙碌的工作後
I mean, wouldn't you like to be with someone

1350
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,550
有個人陪著你嗎
while you work through your shit?

1351
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,980
一個理解你的人 一個關心你的人
Someone who understands you, someone who cares about you?

1352
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:30,250
陪著你的人 不是嗎
That way you have someone to hang out with, right?

1353
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,420
一同與世界為敵
You against the world.

1354
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,560
和你親熱
You've got someone to make out with.

1355
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,330
坐在沙發上跟你吃外賣的人
Someone to sit on the sofa and eat takeout with.

1356
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:46,730
和你一起變老
Someone to get old and grey and,

1357
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,850
和你一起看"七寶奇謀"的人
I don't know, watch The Goonies with.

1358
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,420
喂 你們
Hey, you guys!

1359
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,190
天哪 你看過這電影
Oh, my god, you saw it!

1360
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,640
看過兩遍
Twice.

1361
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,100
你竟然看了兩遍
You saw it twice?

1362
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,220
你肯定很喜歡這部電影
Wow, you must have liked it.

1363
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,210
好吧
Okay, so,

1364
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,660
我們接下來幹點啥
what are we gonna do?

1365
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,140
這太瘋狂了
This is insane.

1366
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,370
我兩小時前剛和佈雷迪分手
I just broke up with Brady not even two hours ago.

1367
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:22,950
我們不能... 不能做這種事
We can't... we can't do this now.

1368
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,010
我明白 如果你要我閉嘴 我會安安靜靜的
I know. I know. I know. And if you want me to shut up, I will,

1369
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,940
如果真的是這樣的話
but if that's the case,

1370
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,040
為什麼今晚你會回來
then why did you come back tonight?

1371
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:35,210
為什麼... 你會回"結束"酒吧呢
Why did you... Why did you come back to the EndUp?

1372
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,290
你覺得我們應該做些什麼
What are you suggesting we do?

1373
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,670
我是不會去丹佛的
I'm not going to Denver, that's for sure,

1374
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:47,630
而且我真的要離開這裏
and I really need to get out of here.

1375
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,330
所以...
Then...

1376
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,400
那我去德州呢
How about I come to Texas?

1377
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,330
-什麼  -對
- What? - Yeah.

1378
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:01,390
我可以和你一起去 或者等你定居好了我再去
I'll come with you or I'll go there after you've gotten settled.

1379
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,680
然後呢 你在丹佛有工作
And do what? You have a job in Denver.

1380
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,120
你這裏還有工作
You have another job lined up here.

1381
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,570
好吧 我可以遠程工作
Yeah, well, I can work remotely.

1382
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,180
我還想有自己的公司 一直想這麼做
I'll do my own thing. I've always wanted to do that.

1383
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,730
德州有電腦嗎
Do they have computers in Texas?

1384
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,110
你酒醒之後怎麼辦
And what happens when you've sobered up?

1385
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,070
當婚禮結束
When the wedding's over and

1386
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,360
浪漫感褪去
you've lost this sense of romance?

1387
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,930
-這就是你擔心的嗎  -對
- Is that what you're scared of? - Of course I am.

1388
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,330
我很瞭解你
I have met you.

1389
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:37,330
要是你再一次驚慌了
What happens when you freak out again.

1390
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:42,300
我已經厭倦了照顧別人
I am so sick of taking care of people.

1391
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,220
我不想再經歷一次了
I don't want to do that again.

1392
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,120
我不需要你照顧我 裏奇
I don't need you to take care of me, Richie.

1393
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,770
我不需要
Okay, I don't.

1394
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:50,650
我只是...
I just...

1395
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,170
我想和你在一起
I want to be with you while you figure out

1396
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:58,160
不管你做出什麼決定
whatever it is you need to figure out.

1397
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,280
你曾經告訴過我
You told me once that

1398
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,380
你當初差一點點就愛上我了
you were this close to falling in love with me.

1399
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,790
我以前愛著你
I was in love with you back then,

1400
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,960
現在依舊愛著你
I'm in love with you now,

1401
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,440
只是當時我很恐懼這種感覺
except I was afraid of that feeling.

1402
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,440
我現在不怕了
I'm not afraid anymore.

1403
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:26,300
要是沒結果呢
What happens if it doesn't work out?

1404
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,740
之後我們怎麼辦
What do we do then?

1405
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,510
要是沒結果也無所謂
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

1406
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,420
至少我們試過
But at least we tried.

1407
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:40,700
你想試試嗎
Do you want to try?

1408
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,440
快進來 來啊
Come in here! Come on.

1409
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,970
正如你所見 這座城市有些時候能把我逼瘋
You know, this city drives me crazy sometimes,

1410
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,220
現在看來 這真是世界上最棒的地方
but right now it feels like the best place in the world.

1411
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,840
確實如此
Yes, it does.

1412
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,320
天吶 這些雞蛋雖然看起來很噁心 可味道還不錯
My god. These eggs are disgusting, but they are so good.

1413
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,530
-這是啥 月光石嗎  -說不定呢
- What is that? Is that the moon-rocks? - Maybe.

1414
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,330
埃迪 我覺得你應該回來
Eddie, I think you should come back.

1415
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,230
-你們覺得咋樣啊  -同意
- What do you think, guys? - Yes.

1416
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:29,810
從山上下來
Come back down from the mountains

1417
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,250
然後和我們幸福的生活在一起
and live with us happily ever after.
