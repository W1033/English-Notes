Hi. I gave an “occasional$\color{red}{^*}$ address” for a graduation ceremony at my old Uni, The University of Western Australia. Here is the video. The text is below. Hope there’s something in it for you.

(我在我以前的大学--西澳大利亚大学的毕业典礼上做了一个 "临时演讲"。这里是视频。文字在下面。希望对你有帮助。)

“In darker days, I did a corporate$\color{red}{^*}$ gig$\color{red}{^*}$ at a conference for this big company who made and sold accounting software. In a bid$\color{red}{^*}$, I presume$\color{red}{^*}$, to inspire their salespeople to greater heights, they’d forked out 12 grand for an Inspirational Speaker who was this extreme sports dude who had had a couple of his limbs$\color{red}{^*}$ frozen off when he got stuck on a ledge$\color{red}{^*}$ on some mountain. It was weird. Software salespeople need to hear from someone who has had a long, successful and happy career in software sales, not from an overly-optimistic$\color{red}{^*}$, ex-mountaineer$\color{red}{^*}$. Some poor guy who arrived in the morning hoping to learn about better sales technique$\color{red}{^*}$ ended up going home worried about the blood flow to his extremities$\color{red}{^*}$. It’s not inspirational – it’s confusing.

("在黑暗的日子里，我在一个会议上为一家制造和销售会计软件的大公司做了一个企业演出。我猜想，为了激励他们的销售人员达到更高的水平，他们花了1.2万美元请了一位励志演讲者，他是一个极限运动者，当他被困在某座山上的壁架上时，他的几个肢体被冻掉了。这很奇怪。软件销售人员需要听一个在软件销售方面有长期、成功和快乐的职业生涯的人说，而不是听一个过于乐观的前登山者说。一些可怜的人早上来到这里，希望能学到更好的销售技巧，结果回家后却担心自己的四肢血流不畅。这不是鼓舞人心的--是令人困惑的。)

And if the mountain was meant to be a symbol of life’s challenges, and the loss of limbs a metaphor for sacrifice, the software guy’s not going to get it, is he? Cos he didn’t do an arts degree, did he? He should have. **Arts degrees are awesome. And they help you find meaning where there is none.** And let me assure you, there is none. Don’t go looking for it. Searching for meaning is like searching for a rhyme scheme in a cookbook: you won’t find it and you’ll bugger up your soufflé.

(如果这座山是为了象征人生的挑战，而失去四肢则是对牺牲的隐喻，那么那个软件公司的人就不会明白，是吗？因为他没有读过艺术学位，不是吗？他应该有。文科学位很了不起。他们帮助你在没有意义的地方找到意义。(Q: 那哲學算是文科嗎? LOL) 让我向你保证，根本没有意义。不要去寻找它。寻找意义就像在烹饪书中寻找韵律一样：你不会找到它，你会把你的蛋奶酥弄坏。)

Point being, I’m not an inspirational speaker. I’ve never lost a limb on a mountainside, metaphorically or otherwise. And I’m certainly not here to give career advice, cos… well I’ve never really had what most would call a proper job.

(重点是，我不是一个鼓舞人心的演讲者。我从来没有在山坡上失去过肢体，无论是隐喻还是其他。我当然也不是来给职业建议的，因为......我从来没有过大多数人所说的正式工作。)

However, I have had large groups of people listening to what I say for quite a few years now, and it’s given me an inflated sense of self-importance. So I will now – at the ripe old age of 38 – bestow upon you nine life lessons. To echo, of course, the 9 lessons and carols of the traditional Christmas service. Which are also a bit obscure.

(然而，在过去的几年里，我有一大群人在听我说的话，这让我有了一种自我膨胀的感觉。因此，我现在--在38岁这个成熟的年龄--将授予你们九堂人生课。当然，是为了呼应传统圣诞仪式中的九堂课和颂歌。这也有点晦涩难懂。)

You might find some of this stuff inspiring, you will find some of it boring, and you will definitely forget all of it within a week. And be warned, there will be lots of hokey similes, and obscure aphorisms which start well but end up not making sense.

(你可能会发现其中一些东西很有启发性，你会发现其中一些很无聊，而且你肯定会在一周内忘记所有的东西。请注意，会有很多虚伪的比喻和晦涩的警句，开头很好，但最后没有意义。)

So listen up, or you’ll get lost, like a blind man clapping in a pharmacy trying to echo-locate the contact lens fluid.

(所以听好了，否则你会迷失方向，就像一个盲人在药店里鼓掌，试图对隐形眼镜液进行回声定位。)

Here we go:

## 1. You Don’t Have To Have A Dream. (第一: 你不一定要擁有夢想)

Americans on talent shows always talk about their dreams. Fine, if you have something that you’ve always dreamed of, like, in your heart, go for it! After all, it’s something to do with your time… chasing$\color{red}{^*}$ a dream. And if it’s a big enough one, it’ll take you most of your life to achieve, so by the time you get to it and are staring into the abyss$\color{red}{^*}$ of the meaninglessness of your achievement, you’ll be almost dead so it won’t matter.

(参加选秀节目的美国人总是谈论他们的梦想。好吧,如果你一直都想去做某件事, 打從心底想要去完成的, 那就去做吧! 毕竟，这与您的时间有关... 追逐梦想。如果它足够大，它会花费你一生的大部分时间来实现，所以当你到达它并凝视着你的成就毫无意义的深渊时，你都已經快死了, 對你來說一切也不重要了. )

I never really had one of these big dreams. And so I advocate$\color{red}{^*}$ passionate$\color{red}{^*}$ dedication$\color{red}{^*}$ to the pursuit$\color{red}{^*}$ of short-term goals. Be micro-ambitious. Put your head down and work with pride on whatever is in front of you… you never know where you might end up. Just be aware that the next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery$\color{red}{^*}$. Which is why you should be careful of long-term dreams. If you focus too far in front of you, you won’t see the shiny thing out the corner of your eye. Right? Good. Advice. Metaphor$\color{red}{^*}$. Look at me go.

(我从来没有真正拥有一个这样的大梦想。因此，我主张热情奉献，追求短期目标。要有微观的野心(/在小目標上保持雄心)。埋頭苦幹並以此為榮, 專注在眼前的事物上... 你永遠不知道你的重點會在哪裡. 留意你下一個值的追逐的目標, 可能就在你身邊. 這就是為什麼你應該小心看待遠程的夢想. 當你把眼光放得太遠, 你可能會因為而錯失眼前耀眼的機會. 對嗎? 很好. 建議. 隱喻. 看著我走.)

## 2. Don’t Seek Happiness (第二: 別刻意尋找快樂)
Happiness is like an orgasm: if you think about it too much, it goes away. Keep busy and aim to make someone else happy, and you might find you get some as a side effect. We didn’t evolve to be constantly content. Contented Australophithecus Afarensis got eaten before passing on their genes.

(快樂就像性高潮, 如果你一直想著它, 它反而不會來. 保持忙碌, 以使別人快樂為目的, 你可能發現你得到了一些額外的收穫. 我们的进化并不是为了不断满足. 满足的澳人猿在传递他们的基因之前就被吃掉了.)

## 3. Remember, It’s All Luck (一切都跟運氣有關)
You are lucky to be here. You were incalculably lucky to be born, and incredibly lucky to be brought up by a nice family that helped you get educated and encouraged you to go to University. Or if you were born into a horrible family, that’s unlucky and you have my sympathy… but you were still lucky: lucky that you happened to be made of the sort of DNA that made the sort of brain which – when placed in a horrible childhood environment – would make decisions that meant you ended up, eventually, graduating University. ~~Well done you, for dragging yourself up by the shoelaces, but you were lucky. You didn’t create the bit of you that dragged you up. They’re not even your shoelaces.~~

(你很幸运能来到这里。 你的出生是无比幸运的，你被一个帮助你接受教育并鼓励你上大学的好家庭抚养长大是非常幸运的。或者，如果你出生在一个可怕的家庭，那是不幸的，你得到了我的同情... 但你仍然很幸运：幸运的是，你碰巧是由制造大脑的 DNA 组成的——当被置于可怕的童年时环境——会做出决定，这意味着你最终会从大学毕业。~~干得好，你被鞋带拖了起来，但你很幸运。 你没有创造你的那一点拖累你。 它们甚至不是你的鞋带。~~)

~~I suppose I worked hard to achieve whatever dubious achievements I’ve achieved … but I didn’t make the bit of me that works hard, any more than I made the bit of me that ate too many burgers instead of going to lectures while I was here at UWA.~~

Understanding that you can’t truly take credit for your successes, nor truly blame others for their failures will humble you and make you more compassionate.

(若你了解到你的成就並不完全是你的功勞, 而失敗也不能把過失完全歸咎他人, 這會讓你更謙虛, 讓你更有同情心.) 

Empathy is intuitive, but is also something you can work on, intellectually.

(同理心是一种直觉，但你也可以用你的智慧去栽培它.)


## 4. Exercise (去運動)
I’m sorry, you pasty, pale, smoking philosophy grads, arching your eyebrows into a Cartesian curve as you watch the Human Movement mob winding their way through the miniature traffic cones of their existence: you are wrong and they are right. Well, you’re half right – you think, therefore you are… but also: you jog, therefore you sleep well, therefore you’re not overwhelmed by existential angst. You can’t be Kant, and you don’t want to be.

(你們這些頹廢抽煙的哲學系畢業生, 當你把眉頭皺成像笛卡爾曲線一樣, 看著人類為了生存在擁擠的人生道路上力爭上游時: 你錯了, 他們才是對的. 好吧, 你對了一半 -- 你思故你在... 但同时：你慢跑，所以你睡得好，因此你没有被存在的焦虑所淹没。你不會成为康德，你也不想成为他。)

Play a sport, do yoga, pump iron, run… whatever… but take care of your body. You’re going to need it. Most of you mob are going to live to nearly a hundred, and even the poorest of you will achieve a level of wealth that most humans throughout history could not have dreamed of. And this long, luxurious life ahead of you is going to make you depressed!

(做运动、做瑜伽、打铁、跑步......不管怎样......但是要照顾好你的身体。你将会需要它。你们中的大多数人将活到接近 100 岁，
即使你们中最贫穷的人也将达到历史上大多数人无法梦想的财富水平。而在這奢華的人生漫漫長路將會讓你憂鬱(忧郁))

But don’t despair! There is an inverse correlation between depression and exercise. Do it. Run, my beautiful intellectuals, run. And don’t smoke. Natch.

(但不要绝望! 抑郁症和运动之间有一个反比的关系。做到这一点。跑步，我美丽的知识分子，跑步。而且不要抽烟。当然。)

## 5. Be Hard On Your Opinions (嚴格審視自己的意見)
A famous bon mot asserts that opinions are like arse-holes, in that everyone has one. There is great wisdom in this… but I would add that opinions differ significantly from arse-holes, in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined.

(有一句著名的格言说，意见就像屁眼一样，每个人都有一个。这句话很有智慧......但我要补充的是，意见与屁眼有很大的不同，因为你的意见应该被不断地彻底检查。)

We must think critically, and not just about the ideas of others. Be hard on your beliefs. Take them out onto the verandah and beat them with a cricket bat.

我们必须进行批判性的思考，而不仅仅是思考别人的想法。对自己的信念要严格要求。把它们带到阳台上，用板球棒打它们。

Be intellectually rigorous. Identify your biases, your prejudices, your privilege.

在智力上要严格要求自己。找出你的偏见、你的成见、你的特权。

Most of society’s arguments are kept alive by a failure to acknowledge nuance. We tend to generate false dichotomies, then try to argue one point using two entirely different sets of assumptions, like two tennis players trying to win a match by hitting beautifully executed shots from either end of separate tennis courts.

社会上的大多数争论都是因为不承认细微差别而保持活力。我们倾向于产生错误的二分法，然后试图用两套完全不同的假设来论证一个观点，就像两个网球运动员试图通过从不同网球场的两端打出漂亮的球来赢得比赛。

By the way, while I have science and arts grads in front of me: please don’t make the mistake of thinking the arts and sciences are at odds with one another. That is a recent, stupid, and damaging idea. You don’t have to be unscientific to make beautiful art, to write beautiful things.

顺便说一下，虽然我面前有理科和文科的毕业生：请不要错误地认为艺术和科学是相互矛盾的。这是一个最近的、愚蠢的、破坏性的想法。你不必不科学地去做美丽的艺术，去写美丽的东西。

If you need proof: Twain, Adams, Vonnegut, McEwen, Sagan, Shakespeare, Dickens. For a start.

如果你需要证明。吐温、亚当斯、冯内古特、麦克伊文、萨根、莎士比亚、狄更斯。作为一个开始。

You don’t need to be superstitious to be a poet. You don’t need to hate GM technology to care about the beauty of the planet. You don’t have to claim a soul to promote compassion.

你不需要迷信就能成为一个诗人。你不需要讨厌转基因技术来关心地球的美丽。你不需要声称自己有灵魂来促进同情心。

Science is not a body of knowledge nor a system of belief; it is just a term which describes humankind’s incremental acquisition of understanding through observation. Science is awesome.

科学不是一个知识体系，也不是一个信仰体系；它只是一个描述人类通过观察逐步获得理解的术语。科学是令人敬畏的。

The arts and sciences need to work together to improve how knowledge is communicated. The idea that many Australians – including our new PM and my distant cousin Nick – believe that the science of anthropogenic global warming is controversial, is a powerful indicator of the extent of our failure to communicate. The fact that 30% of this room just bristled is further evidence still. The fact that that bristling is more to do with politics than science is even more despairing.

艺术和科学需要合作，以改善知识的交流方式。许多澳大利亚人--包括我们的新总理和我的远房表亲尼克--认为人为全球变暖的科学是有争议的，这个想法有力地说明了我们沟通失败的程度。这间屋子里有30%的人都在发抖，这进一步证明了这一点。这种畏惧更多的是与政治有关，而不是与科学有关，这一事实更加令人绝望。



## 6. Be a teacher. (第六: 當個老師)
Please? Please be a teacher. Teachers are the most admirable and important people in the world. You don’t have to do it forever, but if you’re in doubt about what to do, be an amazing teacher. Just for your twenties. Be a primary school teacher. Especially if you’re a bloke – we need male primary school teachers. Even if you’re not a Teacher, be a teacher. Share your ideas. Don’t take for granted your education. Rejoice in what you learn, and spray it.

## 7. Define Yourself By What You Love (第七: 以喜好來定義自己)
I’ve found myself doing this thing a bit recently, where, if someone asks me what sort of music I like, I say “well I don’t listen to the radio because pop lyrics annoy me”. Or if someone asks me what food I like, I say “I think truffle oil is overused and slightly obnoxious”. And I see it all the time online, people whose idea of being part of a subculture is to hate Coldplay or football or feminists or the Liberal Party. We have tendency to define ourselves in opposition to stuff; as a comedian, I make a living out of it. But try to also express your passion for things you love. Be demonstrative and generous in your praise of those you admire. Send thank-you cards and give standing ovations. Be pro-stuff, not just anti-stuff.

(我发现自己最近有点这样做，如果有人问我喜欢什么样的音乐，我会说 "我不听广播，因为流行歌词让我很烦"。或者如果有人问我喜欢什么食物，我就说 "我觉得松露油用得太多了，有点令人厌恶"。我在网上经常看到这种情况，人们对成为亚文化的一部分的想法是讨厌酷玩乐队、足球、女权主义者或自由党。我们倾向于用反对的东西来定义自己；作为一个喜剧演员，我以这个为生。但也要尝试表达你对你所喜爱的事物的热情。在赞美你所崇拜的人时，要表现得慷慨大方。发送感谢卡并起立鼓掌。要支持物质，而不仅仅是反对物质。)

## 8. Respect People With Less Power Than You. (第八: 尊重位階比你低的人)
I have, in the past, made important decisions about people I work with – agents and producers – big decisions based largely on how they treat wait staff in restaurants. I don’t care if you’re the most powerful cat in the room, I will judge you on how you treat the least powerful. So there.

(以前, 我每次做出重要決定時, 像是工作上對接的經紀人和製作人, 通常重要的決定取決於我們在餐廳討論時他們對待服務生的態度. 我不管你是什麼咖, 我會根據你如何對待沒有權利的人的態度來評判你. 就是這樣.)


## 9. Don’t Rush. (第九: 別急)
You don’t need to already know what you’re going to do with the rest of your life. I’m not saying sit around smoking all day, but also, don’t panic. Most people I know who were sure of their career path at 20 are having midlife crises now.

(你不需要已经知道你的余生要做什么。我不是说整天坐在那里抽烟，但是，也不要惊慌。我认识的大多数人在20岁时就确定了自己的职业道路，现在却出现了中年危机。)

I said at the beginning of this ramble that life is meaningless. It was not a flippant assertion. I think it’s absurd: the idea of seeking “meaning” in the set of circumstances that happens to exist after 13.8 billion years worth of unguided events. Leave it to humans to think the universe has a purpose for them. However, I am no nihilist. I am not even a cynic. I am, actually, rather romantic. And here’s my idea of romance:

(我在这篇漫谈的开头说，生活是没有意义的。这并不是一个轻率的断言。我认为这很荒唐：在经历了138亿年的无指导事件之后，在碰巧存在的一系列环境中寻求 "意义" 的想法。把它留给人类，认为宇宙对他们有一个目的。然而，我不是虚无主义者。我甚至不是一个愤世嫉俗的人。事实上，我是相当浪漫的。这就是我对浪漫的看法。)

You will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and, god, it’s tiring. And you will sometimes be happy and sometimes sad. And then you’ll be old. And then you’ll be dead.

(你很快就会死去. 生活有时会显得漫长而艰难, 而且, 天哪, 这很累人. 而你有时会快樂, 有时会悲伤. 然后你老了. 死了.)

There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence, and that is: fill it. Not fillet. Fill. It.

(对于这种空虚的存在，只有一件明智的事情可以做，那就是：填充它。不是填塞。是填满。它。)

And in my opinion (until I change it), life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can, taking pride in whatever you’re doing, having compassion, sharing ideas, running(!), being enthusiastic. And then there’s love, and travel, and wine, and sex, and art, and kids, and giving, and mountain climbing … but you know all that stuff already.

(在我看来（直到我改变它），生命最好的填充方式是尽可能多地学习关于你能做的事情，对你正在做的任何事情感到自豪，有同情心，分享想法，跑步（!），充满热情。然后还有爱情、旅行、酒、性、艺术、孩子、奉献和登山......但你已经知道所有这些东西。)

It’s an incredibly exciting thing, this one, meaningless life of yours. Good luck.

(這是一件令人難以置信的令人興奮的事情, 這就是你毫無意義的生活. 祝你好運.)

Thank you for indulging me.

(謝謝你們對我的包容.)
