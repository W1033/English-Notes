## 内容 (Content)y
### 1. 什么是从句?
从句就是 `一个句子做了另一个句子的成分`. 从句只有 3 类 (名词从句, 定语从句,状语从句)

**1.**  一个句子充当了 `名词` 的成分, 那么它就叫做 `名词性从句`。在简单句中, 名词(noun)在句子中可以作什么成分?

(1) 主语
>  Dogs like bones. 名词(dogs)狗作主语.

(2) 宾语
>  接上句示例: (bones)骨头作宾语.

(3) 表语
>  I [am] a [student]. 名词 student 作为系统词 am 后的表语.

(4) 同位语: 位于同一位置的名词结构. (同位关系, 同一个事物.)
>  Beijing, the capital of china, is my hometown.

根据上面的(1)(2)(3)(4)可以得知: 名词性从句细分为 4 类, 即: `主语从句`, `宾语从句`, `表语从句`, `同位语从句`.

**2.** 一个句子充当了 `定语` 的成分, 那么它就叫做 `形容词从句(定语从句)`。定语从句: 可以当做**形容词**使用的从句.

>  The man <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #ffa907;">
> who wrote the book </span> is famous.  [写这本书] 的人很有名.
>
> *从句 "who wrote the book" 作为定语修饰名词 "The man".*

**3.** 一个句子充当了 `状语` 的成分, 那么它就叫做 `副词性从句(状语从句))`。状语从句: 可以当做**副词**使用的从句.

> <span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #ffa907;">
> After you left,</span> we all missed you.  [在你离开后], 我们都很想念你. 
>
> *从句 "after you left" 作为状语修饰主句 "we all missed you."*

状语从句 = `连词` + `简单句`.

### 2. 英文中的从句概念包括:
- 2.1 `复合句`(compound sentence): 常称为 `并列句`, 指的是用 **连词**连接多个简单句组成的句子. 
- 2.2 `复杂句`(complex sentence): 也称为从句,主从复合句; 用 `代词`, `副词`,`连词(连接词)` 把一个简单句作为另外一个简单句的从属成分的句子.
  

2 点说明:
- (1) 上面这 2 种是专业语法的说法, 而**一般我们说的复杂句其实指的是比较难比较复杂的句子**, 可能是简单句、复合句或者复杂句。要学好语法, 首先就要准确定义这些名词, 不然会混, 很多争论也是从此而来.
- (2) 复合句和复杂句还可以融合为复合复杂句, 也称为并列复杂句, 不过理解了复合句和复杂句, 就不用单独讨论.

### 3. 从句的一般结构
- 从上⾯的复合句和复杂句的定义就可以看出来，从句都是两个句⼦连接起来，`代词`、`副词`、
  `连词` 都笼统地称为 `引导词`，所以从句的⼀般结构是：
  
  **`简单句1` + `引导词` + `简单句2`**

  关键点在引导词上, 分述如下:
    + 复合句的引导词: `连词` (即连接词: 见同级目录 `./README.MD`)
    + 复杂句的引导词: `代词`, `副词`, `连词`.

  根据引导词能够连接的句子的完整性 (即完整句子与不完整句子), 引导词可以分为 2 类:
    + **代词 + 不完整句子 (即 `SVtO` 缺少 `S` 或者缺少 `O`)**
    + **副词/连词 + 完整句子 (即 `SVO` 俱全或者 `SVi` 不需要 `O`)**


### 4. 复合句 (cmpound sentence)
- **`复合句` = `简单句1` + `并列连词` + `简单句2`**
- 而并列连词又及其简单, 即 `fanboys` +  `and yet` + `and so`, fanboys
  即下列连词的首字母缩写: `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`:
    + `for`: I'd better take an umbrella, **for** it is going to rain.
    + `and`: He is so handsome **and** the princess is willing to marry him.
    + `nor`: The city is not beautiful, **nor** is it clean.
    + `but`: I like action movies **but** she doesnʼt like them.
    + `or`: Take the chance, **or** you will regret.
    + `yet`: She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the
      room doors were open, **yet** following her regular practice she had shut
      them before going out.
    + `so`: It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time,
      **so** they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to
      keep an appointment.
    + 
    + `and yet`: She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed
      that all the room doors were open, **and yet** following her
      regular practice she had shut them before going out.
    + `and so`: It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time,
      **and so** they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out 
      to keep an appointment.
- 3 点说明：
    + `and yet` 和 `and so` 是可以合并的两个连词，其他连词只能⽤⼀个 
      (⽐如 `and or` 就不对，`and but` 也不对，当然 `and/or` 另当别论。
    + `and therefore`、`and thus` 等并不是连词合⽤，因为 `therefore/thus` 是副词
      ，所以在 [`and therefore` + `简单句2`] 中，`therefore` 只是副词做状语。
    + 常⻅伪连词: 
        - `therefore`
        - `however`
        - `moreover/furthermore`
        - `nonetheless/nevertheless`
        - `notwithstanding`
        - `then`
    + 错误⽤法:
        - `[句子1, however, 句子2]`
    + 正确用法:
        - (1) [句⼦1. However, 句⼦2.]
        - (2) [句⼦1; however, 句⼦2.]
        - (3) [句⼦1. 句⼦2第⼀部分, however, 句⼦2剩余部分.]
        - (4) [句子1. 句子2, however.]

### 5. 复杂句 (complex sentence)
- **`复杂句` = `主句` + `从句` = `简单句1` +**
  <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ffa907;">引导词 + 简单句2</span>
  **(划线部分即是从句)**
- 复杂句分为 3 类, 6 种, 如下表:

  | 词性 | 从句(按词性) | 典型成分 | 从句(按语法成分) |
  |:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
  |(1)名词 (n) |名词性从句|主语; 宾语; 表语; 同位语 | 主语从句; 宾语从句; 表语从句; 同位语从句 |
  |(2)形容词(adj)|形容词性从句|定语|定语从句|
  |(3)副词(adv)|副词性从句|状语|状语从句|

  (因为形容词性从句只有定语从句一种, 副词性从句只有状语从句一种, 所以打大家习惯的叫法是:
  `名词性从句`, `定语从句`, `状语从句`, 但是从今天起不要了哦，请专业起来哦...其实⽆所谓的.)
#### 5.1 名词性从句
##### 5.1.1 名词性从句有 4 类, 如下表:
- |名词性从句|语法解释|
  |:------:|:------:|
  | 主语从句 | 从句做主语 |
  | 宾语从句 | 从句做宾语 |
  | 表语从句 | 从句做表语 |
  | 同位语从句| 跟在抽象名词后说明其具体内容 |

##### 5.1.2 名词性从句的讲解规律一般分 2 类:
1. 先讲 主语/宾语/表语从句:
    + (1) `that`/`whether`/`if` + 完整句⼦
        - [That you are right] is a lie. (主语从句)
        - I believe (that) [you are right]. (宾语从句)
        - It is not [that you lied to me]; 
        - it is that you do not regret it at all now. 
        - I donʼt know whether/ if he is trustworthy
    + (2) 特殊疑问词的陈述语序
        - **what**: What he wants to tell us is not clear.
        - **whatever**: Whatever he does is not my concern.
        - **which**: It is still unknown which team will win the match.
        - **whichever**: I donʼt care whichever team will win the match.
        - **who**: Who will win the match is still unknown.
        - **whoever**: Whoever leaves the room last ought to turn off
          the lights
        - **whom**: I donʼt know whom he gave that ring to.
        - **whomever**: I donʼt care whomever he gave that ring to.
        - **where**: Where the English evening will be held has not yet
          been announced.
        - **wherever**: Wherever the English evening will be held is not 
          my business.
        - **when**: I hate it when they speak with their mouths full of food.（it是形式宾语）
        - **whenever**: Whenever they speak with their mouths full of food 
          is a pain for me.
        - **whose**: Please tell me whose umbrella this is.
        - **whosever**: Whosever umbrella this is is not my business.
        - **how**: It is known to us how he became a writer.
        - **however**: However he became a writer is his own secret.
        - **why**: I still don't understand why he chose to betray me.
2. 再讲同位语从句:
- 同位语从句 = `抽象名词` + `主/宾/表从句` = `抽象名词` + `引导词` + `同位句`
  
  抽象名词概括同位句，同位句解释抽象名词
  
  抽象名词：`fact`/`idea`/`news`/`information`/`order`/`belief`/`advice`/`suggestion`
- (1)  引导词 `that`. (注意这⾥的that是连词)
    + The girls were surprised at the fact **that** ocean ships can sail up
      the Great Lakes.
    + The idea **that** you can do this work well without thinking is
      quite wrong.
    + There was a suggestion **that** Brown should be dropped from the team.
    + He grabbed his suitcase and gave the impression **that**
      he was boarding the Tokyo plane.
    + The thought came to him **that** maybe the enemy had fled the city.
- (2) 引导词 `whether`
    + The question **whether** we should call in a specialist was answered
      by the family doctor.
- 特殊疑问词引导词 `what`/`who`/`whom`/`whose`/`when`/`where`/`how`/`why`
    + I have no idea **what** size she wears.
    + The question **who** will take his place is still not clear.
    + We havenʼt yet settled the question **where** we are going to spend
      our summer vacation. 

#### 5.2 形容词性从句 (定语从句)
- 即定语从句, 引导词在国内的语法教育中常称为关系词, 分 2 类:
    + (1) 关系代词: `that`/`which`/`who`/`whom`/`whose` + 不完整句子.
        + It's the only one **that** I've left.
        + He is the man **whom/that** I saw yesterday.
        + Is he the man **whom/that** wants to see you?
        + They rushed over to help the man **whose** car had broken down.
    + (2) 关系副词 `when`/ `where`/`why` + 完整句子.
        + There are occasions **when** (on which) one must yield.
        + Beijing is the place **where** (in which) I was born.
        + Is this the reason **why** (for which) he refushed our offer?
#### 5.3 副词性从句 (状语从句)
- 副词性从句(状语从句)的引导词只有`副词`和`连词`, 所以**只能引导完整句子**,
  一般按意义分为 9 类:
    + (1) 时间: **When** the dry desert ends, the green grass grows. 
      (当到了沙漠尽头, 绿草便增长.)
    + (2) 地点: **Where** there is a will, there is a way. (有志者,事竟成.) = 
      Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
    + (3) 原因: Collecting provides relaxation for leisure hours, **as** just 
      looking at one's treasures is always a joy.
      (收集可以在闲暇时放松, 因为看着自己的宝藏总是一种乐趣.)
    + (4) 目的: Such a plan should be carried out **so that** the goal of
      education could be better met. (注意这里的 that 是连词). 
      (应当试行这样的计划, 以便实现遇到更好的教育的目标.)
    + (5) 结果: Youth is **so** wonderful **that** it is a crime to waste it.
      (注意这里的 that 是连词) (青春是如此美妙, 以至于浪费它就是一种犯罪.)
    + (6) 条件: **If** the economy still develops at present way, the
      environment will be getting worse and worse.
    + (7) 让步: **Although** advertisements are never without disadvantages,
      their advantages carry more weight.
    + (8) 比较: **The more** we study, **the better** we understand life. 
      (The + 比较级..., the + 比较级...)
    + (9) 方式: if we cannot do **as** we would, we must do **as** we can.
