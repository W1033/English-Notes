Hello, I'm John Russell. 

Let's explore the difference between two vowel sounds: `/ʊ/` and `/u/`

 In previous videos, I described the `/ʊ/` vowel sound as the sound of modals (我把/ʊ/元音描述为情态动词（modal verbs）的发音),  and the `/u/` vowel sound as the sound of schools. 

But let's explore the difference between these sounds in a little more depth (但是让我们更深入地探索一下这些声音之间的区别。). 

Let's start with the tongue. Both sounds have a high tongue  position at the back of the mouth. But to make the ʊ sound, your tongue should be a little higher.  There is also an important difference in the lips. When you make the ʊ sound,  your lips should be a little more relaxed. For the ʊ sound, your lips should be more tense.  ʊ is more of a pure vowel sound, whereas ʊ is a vowel that is followed by a very faint semivowel,  sometimes called an off-glide. That is why some pronunciation books spell the ʊ sound as ʊ.  One problem is that the ʊ and ʊ vowel sounds have some similar spelling patterns. Both can have  ʊ ʊ spellings as in neighborhood, school. And both can be spelled with the letter ʊ,  as in push, super. You can practice making the difference between these sounds with short words.  For example, try saying, Good food. That's all for today. Keep up the good work!
