Hi, I'm your instructor Paul Gruber and welcome to the Pronunciation Workshop--First training session.

嗨, 我是你的讲师 Paul Gruber, 欢迎来到发音研讨会的首节训练课.

I am very excited that you've taken this first step to improve your English pronunciation and I do hope that you enjoy this program and receive great benefits from it.

我很高兴您已迈出第一步来提高英语发音, 并且希望您喜欢这个计划并从中受益匪浅.

Before we begin I wanna(want to) make sure that you have downloaded and printed out the training manual which accompanies this course, if you have not yet done so, please do it soon, because you'll definitely need it.

在我们开始之前, 我想确保您已经下载并打印了本课程随附的培训手册, 如果您尚未这样做, 请尽快进行操作, 因为您肯定会需要它.

Now you may be wondering how is it that I am going to help you change the way you speak. Well, basically(通常), when you learned English as a second language, you kept many of the sounds and speech rules from your first language and you were continuing to use them when you speak English.
this is what gives you an accent.

You were using the sounds and speech rules from your native language instead of the sounds and speech rules of English. And you know why?

Well, because when you learned English nobody ever showed you what the sounds and speech rules of English were, until now.

那是因为, 当年你学英语的时候, 根本没有人告诉过你, 英语(美语)的发音与讲话规则是怎么样的,
直到现在.


That's where I come in. Because I am going to show you and train you on how to use the sounds and speech rules correctly.

所以我来了. 我将向你展示并叫你如何正确地使用这些发音与讲话规则, 

Knowing in using these rules will help you reduce or possibly even eliminate your accent. Now throughout the program you're often going to see me point to my mouth to show you how to produce a particular sound.

了解这些规则的使用方法, 能帮你减少甚至消除口音.
在整个课程中你常常会看到我指着自己的嘴向你展示如何发出一个特定的声音.


I want you to pay close attention and try to copy exactly what it is I'm doing.

I will be showing you how to correctly form new sounds by changing the position of your tongue or changing the shape of your lips.

These small changes are going to make very big changes in your speech.

We're going to practising(*) and I recommend that you use the training manual and try to practice often.

When you practice I recommend that you start out speaking slowly out loud in a strong voice while exaggerating all the mouth movements.

What Would you be doing is retraining the muscles of your mouth and your tongue to move in new ways which will produce a new pronunciation patterns.

These new speech patterns will slowly and eventually involve(*) into your own spontaneous(*) fast speech but it is important that you start out going very slow.

if you can pronounce words and sentences correctly speaking slowly well, 
then you'll have no problem in saying them fast.

I believe practicing is important but I do not believe it's the only key towards success.

**Being aware of your errors**, That's the key.

Being aware and also **recognizing mistakes when you hear them** will probably be the most important factors towards your improvement.

Another thing I'd like you to keep in mind and I'm sure you may have noticed this already is that when most Americans speak you will notice that we seem to open our mouth a lot and there's a great amount of mouth movements.

Watch my mouth when I say something like "Wow, was there really raining on Wednesday!." Did you see how my mouth seemed to move? It wasn't with my lips flat it wasn't "Wow, was there really raining on Wednesday."

There was a lot of movements. My mouth opened wide, but also my whole mouth moved forward.

Now I find many foreign speakers maybe because of their languages characteristics they don't move their mouths much and there is very little facial movement. Because of this, to an American listener, the words often sound mumble(*) making it very difficult for an American listener to understand what it is you said.

One way to be better understood immediately is to become more aware of your speech and to really start opening and moving your mouth.

I'd like to try to observe what I'm talking about. When you speak to native-borned Americans or watch TV or movies notice how when Americans speak generally our mouths really opened big and our lips come forward.

These movements have a lot to do with the sound of American English.
I also want to add that I will often be asking you to repeat words and sentences on these videos.

Try to think as if we're both sitting in the same room and I am directly right in front of you. Listen carefully to the words and sounds that I give you listen carefully to my pronunciation and watch my mouth then repeat the words back to me in your own voice with the techniques(*) that I'm showing you as clearly as you can.

Now at first you may feel a bit foolish talking to your computer screen,but really you shouldn't. Make believe you were speaking directly to me.

刚开始, 对这电脑屏幕讲话会让你觉得有点傻, 但请不要介意, 想象着你是直接和我说话.


You'll find this will be extremely helpful and effective. During the course of this program I will begin by addressing consonant sounds and then later on we'll work with vowel sounds. Now vowel sounds as you know are A, E. I. O. and U. Like ahh, ohh, eee, ehh, ihh, and ooo. And consonant sounds are basically all the other other letters' sounds, like
b, ch, s, t, f, g, sh, w and of course, there are many many more sounds.

The constants that we are going to cover in this first session are the **constant R and the consonant W**.

Okay, are you ready? Here we go. Let's get started! 

Let's start with the Americans **R**. R's are everywhere.
They're probably the most commonly occurring consonant sound in English.

原因之一是 `R` 影响着元音的发音, 尤其是当字母 R 作为单词的为字母或是位于元音之后(如单词 car)

One reason for this is that R's affect vowel sounds especially when an R falls at the end of a word or after a vowel sound as in the word CAR, or the word AIR, or the word TURN.

After working with so many non-native English speakers from around the world. I believe the R sound is one of the main causes for being misunderstood in American English. Therefore, this is why I've chosen to start out with this sound. Now when some languages, like our speaking Spanish, the R is produced by bringing the tongue forward in the front of the mouth, behind the upper teeth and rolling or trilling the tongue~.

 Now when some other languages, like German and French, the R is produced in the back of the throat but this is not how we produce an R sound in the United States. In American English, in order to say a clear R sound to distinct(*) things hafta(have to) happen.
 + The first thing is that our mouth and lips come tightly forward as
   if you would be saying the OO sound. Do this with me, say OO and make sure you bringing your lips all the way forward say OO, that's it.
   You see how your lips are forward? That's what you wanna(want to) do.
   
   This is the position your mouth should be in when you producing an American R like that, and I'll bet you know whenever I told you that.
   
+ Now, the second thing is that your tongue moves back in your mouth.
  It doesn't come forward, it's pulled back. This is probably the opposite of what you are doing right now.
  
  So, for example, in the word "Rock", notice how my lips are coming forward and my tongue moves back in my mouth and I push out the R
  sound. Watch this: RRRock.

**下面的不再翻译, 笔记只需要把书附带的 pdf 培训手册上的做完即可,

Do with me and exaggerate(*) the R: room rock watch it with my head turned room rock you see that see how the whole bottom of my face came forward don't be afraid to do this. This forward mouth movement is what is going to give you an American our sound it's not rock and it's not rock with your lips flat your whole mouth really has to come forward no later I recommend that you practice doing this in front of a mirror while watching your mouth really push out the R. and remember to pull your tongue back now one way of checking if you're doing this correctly with your tongue is by actually putting your finger around an inch into your mouth while saying in our word watch this world like that you should be able to take the tip of your finger and feel the tip of your tongue if you do these 2 simple things bringing your mouth forward and pull your tongue back I'm telling you your speech is going to be clearer and you're going to sound so much better okay we're going to start out with ours at the beginning of words here we go repeat after me. Rule rock who rip. Reach. Rolled. Rain. Tahun rich. Rolm. Raises. Rolled. Rice very good now repeat this sentence. The room around no rooster who rushed into the room wrong road very good. Now pronouncing ours like this may feel a little weird to you but if you notice this is how most Americans talk. Okay now let's do ours at the end of words or after a vowel when a foreign speaker produces an R. which is at the end of a word or follows a vowel it's usually very weak it's not really hurt and at least the word opener unfinished like in the word car now you may say, ending within a vowel but it's not common it's car her your tongue has to pull back car and also your lips close a little bit in the front the R. needs to be very strong and you need to close the word car let's practice these words repeat after me car farmer starrer dole or. Bearer for. Where he is and that has a high that will sound he he her. Turn. And poor very good okay now let's discuss R. as in the middle of words. In the word very for example which is a frequently used word in English the R. occurs in the middle of the word it's not a D. sound the word is not very deep vastly it's a very read make sure that the R. sound is strong and your lips are coming forward your tongue is back and you push out the are there rain read like that practice the sentences with me nice and slow. He is they're really they're really nice like that seal my lips are coming all the way forward next one she is Valerie they're really tall. Here are some more practice words with are in the middle repeat after me. Douroux reaction are range E. race car wrecked. Mazhar read. Garage or regional. Haru 3. 0. Maru green. Bagheri. Operation. Care ratings are Rive. Every one. Okay very good.


R 经常和其他一些辅音组合形成混合 `R` 音, 很重要的一点是理解 `R`
音在混合音中占主导地位, 在单词发音前, 你的嘴巴就要向前嘟
Now, R's are often combined with other consonants and form what we call
R blends. It is important to understand that the `R` sound is the strongest sound of the blend and your lips often come forward before you even say the word.
groom rape now notice how my mouth comes forward before I even say the word. Cool right did you see that the notice in the word grape the R. sound is stronger and you even hear it more than the G. sound guru rate. Here are some practice words with our blends first at the beginning of words here we go truth rating tool rust. TrueCrypt. Gur 8. Truro optical during. Prurient. Poor resident. Pool ride out. Cool racked her. We're all. Boot rate okay now in the middle of words. Sub true racked wait tres neutral Russian. Australia. Intro Duce. Com pool press. Pool ration. Be true ray very good. Okay now let's practice R. sounds in sentences these sentences are filled with ours keep the R. sounds strong don't forget to bring your mouth forward and pull your tongue back. Save the sentences with me here we go. The story he read on the radio was incorrect. Her career in the law firm is permanent. Richard and Burak took a ride in there ran new range rover true rock. Everyone will respect the royal family when they arrive at the airport be sure to close the word air it's not an airport it's air air port like that with a strong are sent their trip to the Rocky Mountains will be rescheduled on for riday. Very good okay now let's talk about W. sounds W. sounds are very similar to our sounds the major thing to keep in mind is that it English when you see a W. it always has a W. sound like in the word what again notice how my mouth moves forward one way to make sure you were doing this correctly is to first say with your whole mouth forward who's like that and then open and close your lips to make the W. sound like this wall wall wall wall wall wall wall wall wall that's how you produce a W. what like that it's never a V. sound who were you are like biting down on your lower lip never will be going over V. sounds in the fourth session the reason I mention this is because many foreign speakers especially German speakers say for example but with the V. for the word what instead of saying what will we do which is correct they may say vaudeville V. do and that is not right and many people may not understand you bring your mouth forward on those W. words what move will move we do say with me what will we do very good. Now as I said the W. any are are similar both of them are made with your mouth in a forward position and your tongue pulled back your mouth should be a little bit tighter when you say in our listen to the similarities and differences between these are and W. words. Rec room wick. Right means white it's not a fight with the VA it's white with a W. very good. Also be aware that the W. sound occurs in some words beginning with the letter all like in the words new one and once you might not be aware of this. Practice these W. words with me we'll start out with W. at the beginning of words don't forget to bring your mouth forward at the beginning of each word. Why. Mmhm which. When. What what. White. Wish to wait. Weighing. Very good okay now with W. in the middle of words. All ways way. B. where. Oh wait. Some one we wind hollow when we. Hi Holly ward. Now practice these W. sentences. They'll wind from the west was van re wet remember their restarts with the V. sound followed by a strong R. was very very wet very good. We woke up and watched the white wash cloth. We waited for the waitress to give us water. We had a wonderful time in Washington and Wisconsin. Very good now while we're talking about W. sounds I'd like to mention Q. sounds how R. Q. sounds related well Q. sounds are made with the K. sound. And the W. sound what put together you may not have known that. So for example the word queen which is pronounced with a K. and a strong W. sound cold mac like that. Repeat some of these words beginning with the Q. sound. Cool west June. Cool why it. We can. Qualify. What. Quarterback. Quilt and also in the C. H. word choir. Very good. Okay here it now is a paragraph which contains many R. and W. sounds. You may want to practice reading this paragraph a few times notice how my lips come forward on all my ours and W's try to do the same thing and don't forget to not roll your ours. Don't do that here we go. Ray was born in Russia he dreamed of building the perfect roller coaster at the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He had a 4 rand named food read who lived in Norway for Reds for fashion was designing rail road tracks and his career involved traveling all around the world ray thought it would be perfect if for red designed his roller coaster ride. For red it was creative brilliant and worked well with rail road tracks. He would be the perfect engineer for the project the ride took 2 years to construct and was painted red and white. Everyone really wanted to ride the brand new roller coaster. Very good now if you strongly push out those ours and W's when you practice eventually aren't W. sounds are going to be clear and your speech will be much easier to understand. If you have the time watch this session again and practice your pronunciation along with me then take out your training manual and practice on your own all the word lists and reading passages that are on these videos are in the manual as well. I hope you enjoyed our first session together feel free to watch this session again I'm Paul Gruber with the pronunciation workshop and I'll see you next time.
