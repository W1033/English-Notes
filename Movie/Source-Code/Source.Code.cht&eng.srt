戈德溫  你會告訴我怎麼拆了它嗎
Goodwin,you gonna tell me how to disarm this?

177
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,310
我該...拆了它  還是該忽略它
Should I... unplug it? Or do you want me to just leave it?

178
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,600
那我不管了
I am just gonna leave it.

179
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,520

這只是防範措施  無須擔心
It's a precautionary measure,it's nothing to worry about.

189
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,480
到底是什麼  有安全侵害還是防患於未然
So which is it,security breach or precautionary measure?

肖恩
Shawn!

你有毛病啊  混蛋
What's your problem,asshole?

00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,140
肖恩  你搞什麼鬼
Shawn,what are you doing?

200
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,620
女士  那麼做可不妥
Hey,not a good idea m'am.

201
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,040
最好別  最好別打電話哦
Not a good idea. Oh,that's not a good idea.

你把他下巴打斷了
I think you broke his jaw.

203
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,200
無妨  他跟你一樣  全是幻象
It's ok,he is not any more real than you are.

204
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,750
幻象  你下次自己開車上班去啊
I am not real? How about next time you drive to work!

00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,180
沒有下次了
There's not gonna be a next time.

206
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,670
穩住
Stabilize.

207
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,950
放慢心跳
Lower your pulse.

208
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,640
-你找到炸彈了嗎  -是的
- Did you find the bomb? - Yes...

209
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,240
地上都是液壓油
There is hydraulic fluid all over the floor.

210
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,340
無須擔心  上尉
It's not a concern,Captain.

211
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,360
-這是  -跟我說說炸彈
- What is... -Tell me about the bomb.

212
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,530
他是誰  在監控裏拄根枴杖的男人
Where is that man? I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.

213
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
貌似他才是老大
He looks like he is in charge,

214
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,060
-我要和他談談  -那不可能  上尉
- I wanna talk to him. - That's irrelevant,Captain.

215
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
我要跟你的指揮官談談
I wanna talk to your commanding officer!

216
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,340
你可以在完成任務之後與他交談
You can talk to him upon completion of your mission.

217
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,040
我的分隊在阿富汗  我在那執行任務
My mission is in Afghanistan,where my unit is.

218
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,570
我他媽昨天飛了兩次
I flew two god damn sorties yesterday.

219
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,530
你這兩個月都跟我們在一起
You've been with us for 2 months.

220
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,870
-找到設彈人了嗎  -沒  我的分隊在哪裏
- Did you id the bomber? - No,where is my unit?

221
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,970
這個模擬實驗是誰負責的
And under whose jurisdiction is this simulation?

222
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,100
上尉  這不是模擬實驗
Captain,this is not a simulation.

223
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,770
你肩負了無數人的性命
Lives are depending on you.

224
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,650
什麼性命
What lives?

225
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,300
關於炸彈  你還記得什麼  描述一下引爆器
What do you remember about the bomb? Tell me about the detonator.

226
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,670
等下  什麼性命  你在說什麼
No,no,no,what lives? What you are talking about?

227
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,790
你得跟我說清楚
I need to be briefed!

228
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,300
-長官  得告訴他點內情  -沒事  說吧
- Sir,I need to give him something. - That's fine,go ahead.

229
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,850
準備把他送回去
Get ready to send him back in.

230
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,020
今早  中央標準時間七點四十八分
48 this morning CST,a bomb exploded on a

231
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,670
在芝加哥一輛市郊往返列車上
commuter train outside of Chicago,

232
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,190
一枚炸彈爆炸  無人生還
killing everyone on board.

233
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,770
也就是你所在的那輛列車
And that』s the train that you've been on.

234
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,080
不可能  我不在這嗎  你正在跟我說話
No,no,no,I am right here,you are talking to me right now!

235
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,100
一名叫肖恩·芬特雷斯的男人在那趟列車上
A man named Shawn Fentress was on that train.

236
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,640
總而言之  他現在就是你了
He,for all intents and purposes,is now you.

237
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,110
每多花一秒鐘解釋
Every second spent explaining

238
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,500
就會有更多無辜人的性命陷入危險
things puts more innocent civilians at risk.

239
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,300
胡說八道
This makes no sense.

240
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,320
火車爆炸只是一系列襲擊的第一波
The train explosion was the first attack of a series.

241
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,660
接下來會有更多
There are going to be more.

242
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,280
你找到炸彈了嗎
Now,did you find the bomb?

243
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,310
在廁所裏  水槽上方的通風板那
In the restroom,ventilation panel above the sink.

244
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,650
引爆器是手機  行了嗎
Cell phone detonator. Are we done?

245
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,560
還沒  不過你幹得很不錯  上尉  做得好
Eh,no no. But that's good,that's very very good,Captain. Good.

246
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,180
數據顯示  爆炸時刻
Our record show that 1812

247
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,260
共有1812通電話完成通話
calls ended at the moment of the explosion.

248
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,430
有五十二通電話經由離火車最近的
52 of those calls were tethered to the cell tower

249
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,240
信號塔轉接  其中就有設彈人打的電話
nearest the train. So one of those calls was made by our bomber.

250
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,150
你記不記得爆炸時
Do you remember a freight

251
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,290
正好有輛貨運列車經過
train passing by just before the explosion?

252
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,190
記得
Yes.

253
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,680
在爆炸發生的時刻  貨車剛好經過  
The explosion was timed to engulf the passing freight train

254
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,500
這表明
which means,

255
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,730
設彈人是在可見兩車的情況下打的電話
the bomber had to be watching both trains when the call was made.

256
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,680
五十二個人  其中一個是設彈人
52 callers,one of those is our bomber.

257
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,370
我要你留意同車廂的乘客
I want you to concentrate on the passengers in your car.

258
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,520
瞭解他們  縮小嫌疑人範圍
Get to know them,narrow the suspect pool.

259
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,840
留意那些不動聲響或孤僻的傢伙
Look for ones who seem quiet or withdrawn,

260
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,230
和面露不安的人
who seem nervous.

261
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,930
同樣  你只有八分鐘
As always,you'll have 8 minutes.

262
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,360
八分鐘  然後我又被炸飛
8 minutes,and I blow up again?

263
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,220
是的
Yes.

264
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,110
我要你這次嚴於律己
I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.

265
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,540
執行我們指定你做的任務  
Perform only the task that we assign you.

266
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,100
其它的都無關緊要
Everything else is irrelevant.

267
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,950
驅動通電
Charge the drivers.

268
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,860
我爸爸...
Is my father even...

269
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,200
我採納了你的意見  很不錯
I took your advice... It was very good advice.

270
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,990
-你今天挺沉默的啊  -煩心事比較多  小心
- You're kinda quiet today. - Just got a lot on my mind. Careful.

271
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,580
-對不起啊  -沒事
- Oh,so sorry - Don't worry about it.

272
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,620
你真善良
That's very kind of you.

273
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,190
知書達理
You're very decent.

274
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,150
多謝誇獎
Thank you.

275
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,770
-也很真實  -您的車票
- And real. - Ticket.

276
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,460
-今天還好嗎  -不錯
- How's everything today? - It's good.

277
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,530
-有沒有什麼異常 -沒有
- Anything out of the ordinary? - Uhmm no.

278
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,880
我是指  車上人的行為
I mean behavior on the train.

279
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,000
有沒有...在你看來很詭異的人
Is anything... Anybody seems strange to you?

280
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,680
你就很詭異
You look strange.

281
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,030
你呢  有沒有覺得誰比較可疑
How about you,does anybody looks suspicious?

282
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,810
-你是喝醉了還是怎麼  -過來  就一會
- Are you drunk or something? - Come here. For a second.

283
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,240
來吧
Come on.

284
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,530
-把它當成一個遊戲  -遊戲
- Just think of it as a game. - A game?

285
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,250
他們再正常不過了
They are all so utterly normal,

286
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,560
肖恩  這也是他們的可怕之處
Shawn. That's what so terrifying about them.

287
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,450
也許他們暗中是一夥的
Maybe there's a team network.

288
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,930
睡覺的胖子和牧師還有那幾人有勾搭
The sleeping giant coached with the minister and them out there.

289
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,410
別忽略掉這個憂鬱的大學生  他可是犧牲品
Don't forget the sullen college kid,he is the expendable one.

290
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,840
我打賭  所有人都聽命於售票員
I bet they are all controlled by the conductor.

291
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,850
他就站在那裏專橫地查看車票
Standing there dictatorial demanding tickets.

292
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,610
-你太搞了  -該死的
- You are funny. - Damn it.

293
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,420
-那他呢  -失業中
- What about that guy? - Deposition.

294
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,970
他對面的那女人呢
About that woman sitting across from him?

295
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,370
每週一  她都會去做頭髮  你不知道嗎
Hair appointment,every Monday,you know this.

296
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,880
你跟他們比我跟他們聊的多啊
You talk to this people more than I do.

297
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,810
沒錯  她後面那男的呢
Right,right. And the guy behind her?

298
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,630
他試鏡要遲到了  對吧
He's late for an audition,right?

299
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,880
他可有犯罪記錄  被送進過...
To record offenses... That's the guy that was sided...

300
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,840
酒後駕車  我懂  信號咋樣
A DUI,I know. Hey,how』s the signal in here?

301
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,230
不錯
It's good.

302
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,350
平時教書還不夠刺激嗎  大偵探
Is teaching not stimulating enough for you anymore,Sherlock?

303
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,530
看來我們又遇到種族問題了
Oh oh,now we slip to the racial profiling,that is.

304
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,360
還有別人從廁所出來過嗎
Did anyone else come out of the bathroom over there?

305
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,440
-我看到你從裏面出來  -我
- Well,I saw you coming out of there. - Me?

306
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,750
-沒錯 -不可能
- Yes. – No.

307
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,280
真的是我
Me?

308
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,670
等下先生
Hey Mr..

309
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,120
讓一下  等一下  就一會兒
Hold on,hold on a second. Just hold on a second.

310
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,760
這附近肯定有什麼東西
It's gotta be something near.

311
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,680
一個破手機
A broken phone.

312
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,500
和克莉絲汀娜喝咖啡

313
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,870
-克莉絲汀娜  -怎麼了
- Christina? - Yeah?

314
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,240
等下
Excuse me.

315
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,900
-跟我一起下車  -我們還沒到站呢
- Hey,hey come with me. - This isn't our stop!

316
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,770
-來吧  去走走  -我們不在這站下
- Now come on,let's take a walk. - We don't get off here.

317
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,050
-我一時性起  -你把我嚇到了
- I don't know,just be spontaneous. - You gonna freaking me up...

318
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,170
雖然聽起來很怪  但我總覺得
I know this gonna sound really weird but I have a

319
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,600
這趟車會發生什麼不幸  
really bad feeling about this train

320
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,620
我們該下車  好嗎
and I think that we should get off,ok?

321
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,070
把你的東西帶上
Just get your stuff.

322
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,280
車門即將關閉  請全員上車
All aboard. Doors are closing.

323
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,860
快點  跟我來
Come on,come with me.

324
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,740
-現在呢  -等下  我馬上回來
- So what now? - Wait,one... I'll be right back!

325
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
現在可以去喝咖啡了嗎
Ready to get that coffee now?

326
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,550
對不起  再等一會  就一會好嗎
Oh sorry,yeah,ah... Jus… just one more second,ok?

327
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,790
有完沒完
Oh for God's sake.

328
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,320
不舒服嗎
Feel sick?

329
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,730
暈動病  一直都有
It's motion sickness,I get it all the time.

330
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,190
坐過去點 過去點
Excuse me... Excuse me.

331
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,000
-你在跟蹤我嗎  -能用下你的手機嗎
- Are you following me? - Can I borrow your phone?

332
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,290
不行  我沒有手機
No,I don't have one.

333
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,640
-你肯定  -當然
- Sure? - Yeah,I am sure.

334
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,320
你能不能離我遠點  我要報警了
Why you don't leave me alone please? Or I call the police.

335
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,280
用什麼打  你說你沒有手機
With what? I thought you said you didn't have a phone.

336
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,960
要知道  你沒權利...
You know,you have no right...

337
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,720
你幹什麼  把包還我
What are you doing? Give me my bag back.

338
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,440
你瘋了啊
Are you crazy?

339
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,760
他們是誰
Who are they?

340
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,250
-肖恩  -別過來
- Shawn! - Get back!

341
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,510
肖恩  怎麼回事
Shawn,what's going on?

342
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,170
肖恩
Shawn!

343
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,470
快停下  肖恩
Stop,Shawn!

344
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,610
-不是你  -你到底有什麼毛病啊
- It wasn't you. - What the hell is wrong with you?

345
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,830
-你瘋了嗎  -不  不  不
- Are you insane? - No! No,no!

346
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,890
-它在哪裏  -鬆開我
- Where is it? - Get away from me!

347
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,720
-它到底在哪裏  -離我遠點
- Where is it? - Get away from me,please!

348
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,050
肖恩  肖恩  快起來  肖恩
Shawn,Shawn,get up! Shawn!

349
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,230
肖恩  聽我說  快起來
Shawn,listen to me,get up!

350
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,750
-肖恩  -把手給我  從鐵軌那上來
- Shawn. - Give me your hand,get off the track...

351
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,270
-先生  快點  -肖恩  肖恩  肖恩  快起來
- Mr. C'mon. - Shawn,Shawn,Shawn,get up...

352
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,420
考爾特
Colter.

353
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,630
戈德溫  快回答  聽到我說話了嗎
Goodwin? Come in,do you read me?

354
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,630
斯蒂文斯上尉  這是圍城
Captain Stevens,this is Beleaguered Castle,

355
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
收了嗎  請回答
do you copy? Please respond.

356
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,640
這在結冰  怎麼回事
It's freezing here,what』s going on.

357
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,930
什麼情況
What's that?

358
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,920
他有麻煩了
He is in trouble.

359
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,580
艙內停止供氧了
I think the oxygen just went out.

360
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,300
戈德溫
Goodwin?

361
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,350
戈德溫
Goodwin!

362
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,800
想辦法聯繫上他
Find a way to get through to him.

363
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,660
怎麼了  發生了什麼事
What is it? What's going on?

364
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
三層製冷系統也沒出現異常
It's not the tertiary cooling either.

365
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,880
繼續聯繫他  看他能不能收到信息
Just keep sending strings out,see if he hooks on to something.

366
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,690
我不清楚裏面是個什麼情況
It's hard to say exactly what he's going through.

367
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,040
-長官  -拜託
- Sir? - Please.

368
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,830
我們現在也無能為力
It's not a whole lot we can do from here.

369
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,840
要是情況沒好轉  他還能堅持多久
If nothing changes,how much time does he have?

370
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,040
一會吧
Some...

371
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,480
堅持不了多久
and not long.

372
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,740
莉莉醒來時穿著晚禮服  披著夜禮服斗蓬
Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak,

373
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,260
她手上有五張牌  
in her hand were 5 playing cards.

374
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,110
分別是紅桃Q  梅花4
They were the queen of space,4 of club.

375
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,620
戈德溫  你聽得見嗎
Goodwin,you out there?

376
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,930
戈德溫  誰是戈德溫
Goodwin,who is Goodwin.

377
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,830
我是斯蒂文斯上尉  聽得見嗎
This is Captain Stevens,do you copy?

378
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,850
斯蒂文斯上尉
Captain Stevens?

379
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,330
機艙內停電了
The capsule lost power.

380
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,220
機艙嗎  上尉  你在機艙裏嗎
The capsule? Is that where you are now,Captain,in a capsule?

381
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,500
你難道不知道嗎  你是誰
You should know,who are you?

382
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,600
我去叫戈德溫上尉  去叫她
Let me get Captain Goodwin,get to it!

383
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,170
是你發明了這玩意兒吧
You invented this thing,right?

384
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,230
-是的  -你是這的主管嗎
-I did. - Are you in command here?

385
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,060
是的  你找到設彈人了嗎  上尉
I am. Were you able to locate the information we need,Captain?

386
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,210
沒能找到 長官
That's a negative Sir. I was unable to find the bomber,

387
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,990
但我救了她  一個火車上的乘客
but I did save her. A passenger on the train.

388
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,830
我讓她安全下了車  一個女人
I got her off safely,a woman.

389
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,250
上尉  如果你試圖拯救車上的任何一人
Captain,it's gonna be counterproductive for you

390
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,050
系統都將對你產生反作用
to try to save anyone on that train.

391
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,420
他們在你的任務範疇之外
They're outside the mission.

392
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,110
但她逃過了這場爆炸  或許其他人也可以
Well,but she survived. And maybe the rest could too.

393
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,530
她僅僅是在源代碼中獲救
She survived,but only inside the Source Code.

394
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,630
他們所有人都難逃一死
None of them will be safe.

395
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,010
什麼是源代碼
What is this Source Code?

396
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,420
這是量子力學寓式微積分
It's quantum mechanics parable calculus.

397
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,280
非常複雜
It's very complicated.

398
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,430
試著跟我解釋一下
Try me!

399
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,930
好吧
Fine.

400
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,500
當你關閉電燈  燈泡仍然有餘輝
When a light bulb's turned off,there is an afterglow,

401
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,450
這叫延遲光圈效應  你見過吧
a lingering halo-like effect. You seen it?

402
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,540
-是的  -很好
- Yes. - Of course.

403
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,380
我們的大腦也一樣
The brain is like that,its electromagnetic

404
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,560
人死後大腦的電磁場仍然處於通電狀態
field remains charged,just briefly even after death.

405
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,320
電路依然通暢
Circuits remain open.

406
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,630
大腦還有一個特性
Now there is another peculiarity about the brain.

407
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,780
它存有一個短期記憶軌跡  
It contains a short-term memory track

408
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,550
時長約8分鐘
that's approximately 8 minutes long

409
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,080
就像便利店的安全攝像機一樣
like a convenience store's security camera that

410
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,260
只能在硬盤上記錄
only records the last portion of the day's activity

411
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,660
每一天的最後部分
on its hard drive.

412
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,310
把這兩種現象結合起來
Now combining these two phenomena,circuitry that

413
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,930
人死後腦電圖保持接通  
remains viable postmortem and a memory bank

414
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,390
記憶庫前調8分鐘
that goes back 8 minutes

415
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,880
源代碼就能幫助我們利用那重疊部分
Source Code enables us to capitalize on the overlap.

416
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,220
肖恩·芬特雷斯死在了那列火車上
Shawn Fentress died on that train,

417
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,680
在所有乘客中  他是你最好的紐帶
of all the passengers aboard he was your best link.

418
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,000
你們在性格  體型  和突觸圖譜上
You two share the compatibility in terms of gender,

419
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,660
都十分匹配
body size and your synaptic maps.

420
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,560
-那8分鐘後會怎麼樣  -之後  什麼都沒了
- What happens after the 8 minutes? - After? Nothing.

421
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,690
你將不存在於列車上
You cease to exist on the train.

422
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,670
在源代碼中
You cannot exist inside the Source Code,

423
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,040
你無法存在於芬特雷斯記憶的8分鐘外
beyond Fentress' 8 minutes.

424
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,350
源代碼不是時間穿梭
Source Code is not time travel.

425
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,210
而是對時間的再賦值
Rather,Source Code is time reassignment.

426
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,520
它能讓我們進入與現實平行的世界
It gives us access to a parallel reality.

427
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,330
車上人的遇難是個悲劇
Now the deaths on the train were a tragedy

428
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,750
-但是源代碼使我們...  -不對  我確實救了...
- but Source Code empowers us... - No,but I saved

429
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,460
一個人  那個坐在我對面的女人
one person,that girl,that's always

430
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,080
我讓她下了車
sitting across from me. I pulled her off the train.

431
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:55,560
告訴我她的名字
Give me her name.

432
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,080
克莉絲汀娜  我記不得她姓什麼了
Christina,I don't remember her last name.

433
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,170
-她叫克莉絲汀娜·沃倫   -沒錯
- Her name was Christina Warren. - Yes!

434
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,000
-今年28歲  -就是她
- She was 28. - That's her

435
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,080
生於伊利諾斯州莫林市  死於今早的火車爆炸
born in Moline,Illinois. Died this morning on the train.

436
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,770
不對  我讓她下了車  她沒死
No,no,I pulled her off. She's fine.

437
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,540
-不  她死了  -相信我  她沒死
- No,she isn't. - Believe me,she is.

438
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,940
-相信我  -她看見我被一列快車壓死了
- Believe me. - She saw me get hit by the express train.

439
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,380
-事情沒有任何進展  -不  等等
- This isn't us getting anywhere. - No,no,no,wait,

440
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,840
-等等  -必須把他送回去
- Wait. - We have to send him in.

441
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
第二輪爆炸迫在眼前  拉特裏奇博士
A second attack is imminent,Dr. Rutledge.

442
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,250
-什麼二輪爆炸  -列車的爆炸只是一個開始
- What second attack? - The train was just the beginning.

443
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,690
一系列爆炸的開始
A letter of intent.

444
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,740
抱歉  我聽不懂你們在說什麼
I am sorry,what are you telling me here?

445
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,990
我們得到消息
We have information that

446
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,930
芝加哥市中心是下一個目標
Downtown Chicago is the next target.

447
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,080
他們準備在市中心引爆放射性炸彈
And they're planning to detonate a dirty bomb.

448
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,840
你知道如此程度的爆炸
You have any idea how many people would die

449
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,360
會使多少人喪命嗎
if an explosion of that magnitude were to occur in the city?

450
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,100
說話這會兒  我們已經在疏散人群
We're evacuating as we speak.

451
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,620
我們得在炸彈爆炸之前阻止它  懂嗎
We've to stop it before it happens,do you understand?

452
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,430
如果你找到了設彈人  他的第二次爆炸
If you find the bomber,his second attack,

453
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,870
他的真正意圖  就能被阻止
the real attack,we think,can be prevented.

454
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,700
我們沒時間了
We have very little time left.

455
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,630
爆炸一旦發生就無法挽回了
Out here the clocks only move in one direction.

456
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,040
驅動通電
Charge the drivers.

457
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,610
旁邊車廂的二樓
On the upper deck of the next carriage

458
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,000
有一個乘務員室
there is aconductor's compartment.

459
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,490
裏面有一個保險箱
It's a small office containing a strongbox.

460
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,510
箱內有一把上膛的手槍  找到它
Inside is a loaded handgun. Get to it.

461
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,660
必要時你可以使用任何武力
You are authorized to use whatever force necessary.

462
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,230
我採納了你的建議
I took your advice.

463
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,390
很不錯的建議
It was very good advice.

464
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,830
-你還在這兒  -當然
- You're still here. - Of course I am.

465
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,760
你猜怎麼著
Guess what?

466
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,280
你辭了職  報上了NALSAR的課程
You've quit your job and you enrolled in a NALSAR course.

467
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,990
猜得真準
Good guess.

468
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,050
蘇打水罐  咖啡灑了
Soda can. Coffee spill.

469
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,190
聽著  別接這電話
Listen to me... Don't answer this.

470
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,360
他配不上你
You deserve better than that guy.

471
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,290
把一切留給回憶不是更好嗎
Everything looks more beautiful in retrospect,doesn't it?

472
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,440
你怎麼知道...
How did you know there was....

473
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,280
-你對我有多瞭解  -顯然不是很瞭解
- How well do you know me? - Not that well apparently.

474
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,770
那我們有沒有熟到
Do you know me well enough,that if I did something

475
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,230
如果我做了些不合常理
that looked a little strange and was maybe

476
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,270
甚至有點危險的事情
even a little bit dangerous

477
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,990
然後叫你無論如何都要相信我  你會信嗎
and told you to trust me anyway,that you could do that?

478
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,310
不會
No.

479
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,510
真是大實話
Wow,that was honest.

480
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,170
你漂亮  善良
You are beautiful,you're kind,

481
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,670
也有著令人神傷的坦率
and you are painfully honest.

482
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,200
你是誰
Who are you and what did

483
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,550
你對肖恩·芬特雷斯做了什麼
you do with Shawn Fentress?

484
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,910
這是全新的我
It's the new me.

485
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,540
您的車票

486

我不想傷害你
I don't want to hurt you.

487
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,730
我不會坐回去
No I am not gonna sit in my seat,alright?

488
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,650
他在流血  需要救治
He is bleeding,he needs medical attention.

489
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,730
你想從火車保險箱裏面偷槍
Is it true that you tried

490
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,740
這是真的嗎
to steal a gun out of the train security box?

491
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,140
小心點  女士
Careful ma'm!

492
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,610
-該死  -你瘋了嗎
- Damm it! - What were you thinking?

493
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,020
-我能借用下你手機嗎  -不行
- Can I borrow your phone? - No!

494
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,340
-肖恩  你需要去醫院  -求你了

496
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,160
-我能借用下你手機嗎  -不行
- Can I borrow your phone? - No!

497
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,510
你借我手機做什麼
Why do you want my phone?

498
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,270
要是你只有一分鐘可以活了
What would you do if you only

499
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,260
-你會怎麼做  -我不知道
- had one minute left to live? - I don't know.

500
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
我會打電話給我爸
I would call my dad.

501
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,220
仔細聆聽他的聲音
I would hear his voice

502
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,450
然後跟他道歉
and I'd tell him I am sorry.

503
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,340
告訴我一切都會沒事的
Tell me everything is gonna be ok.

504
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,090
一切都會好起來的
Everything is gonna be ok.

505
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,490
是的  槍在保險箱內
Oh yeah,the gun in the strongbox,

506
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,010
真是個好主意  多謝你了
that was a really great idea. Thanks for that.

507
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,040
-有進展嗎  -我能用下電話嗎
- Did you make any progress? - Can I get access to a phone?

508
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,890
我要和我父親通電話
I need to talk to my father.

509
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,770
我待會試下  不騙你
I will try to work on that soon. Yes,I will try.

510
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,640
戈德溫  我表現得怎樣
Goodwin,how I am doing?

511
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,090
我只是知道自己在這的表現如何
I am just trying to measure my performance here.

512
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,100
你有沒有回去過  我比你表現得好嗎
Have you ever gotten back in? Am I doing any better than you did?

513
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,340
我們這是在浪費寶貴的時間
No,we're wasting valuable time here.

514
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,170
沒有  我只參與過源代碼的指揮工作
No,no,I have never been on the other side

515
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,890
我不適合這項任務
of a Source Code mission. I wouldn't be a viable candidate.

516
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,050
為什麼  CAOC-N  那是什麼
Why not? CAOC-N,what is that?

517
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,410
因為適用範圍很窄
Because the specifications are extremely narrow.

518
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,270
什麼適用範圍
What are they?

519
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,620
上尉  你現在本該已經找到設彈人了
Captain,you should have found the suspect by now.

520
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,690
我們賜予了你如此強大的戰略性武器
This tactical advantage,this tremendous tool that we've given you.

521
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,550
別胡思亂想  暴殄天物
Don't squander it thinking.

522
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,080
拿出實際行動來
Do.

523
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,810
請幫我聯繫我父親
Please contact my father for me.

524
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,890
船到橋頭自然直  上尉
This will stop at some point,Captain.

525
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,210
只要你完成了任務
As soon as you finish the mission.

526
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,840
你表現得真的很好  你能做到的
And you're doing really great. This will end.

527
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:25,050
安置炸彈的人都需要特定的工具
Whoever planted the bomb had to have equipment of some kind.

528
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,450
像手套  開頭頂通風口的螺絲刀  
Gloves,a screwdriver to get into the over the head vent,

529
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,630
手電之類的
flashlight,something.

530
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,310
檢查下乘客的提袋  背包  公文包等等
Check bags,backpacks,briefcases,anything.

531
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,530
於是...我採納了你的建議
So... I took your advice.

532
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,430
-很不錯的建議  -老頭
- It was very good advice. - Hey Grandpa!

533
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,120
-你在幹什麼  -我只是...
- What are you doing? - I am just...

534
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,810
在回想些事情
trying to remember something.

535
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,820
-那是什麼  -軍隊的臂章
- What is that? - It's a Military patch.

536
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,560
你參過軍嗎
Were you in the Military?

537
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,730
是我朋友 他在阿富汗服役
A friend of mine was. He was in Afghanistan

538
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,630
然後就消失了  杳無音信
and he disappeared and no one has heard from him since.

539
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,170
你手機可以上網嗎
Do you have the Internet on your phone?

540
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,350
不行  必須要用很長的網線
No,it's just connected to

541
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,600
連接到辦公室才行
the office by a really long piece of string.

542
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,080
-你能幫我找找這個人的嗎  -沒問題
- Do you think,you can see what you can find on this guy? - Sure.

543
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,840
他最近一直在我的腦海中浮現
He's been on my mind a lot lately,

544
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,340
他是考爾特·斯蒂文斯上尉
his name is Captain Colter Stevens,

545
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,820
任職於第17空降部隊
he is in the 17th Airborne.

546
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,570
你欠我一個人情
Ok,you owe me.

547
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,160
以後請你喝咖啡
I'll buy you a cup of coffee...

548
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,040
要想喝我現在就可以給你買一杯
Why don't I get one for you now.

549
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,220
克莉絲汀娜
Christina!

550
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,540
我最近一直做著一些夢
I've been having these dreams lately...

551
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,720
非常真實的夢
Really vivid...

552
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,740
-你也在我夢中  -真的嗎
- and you've been in them. - Really?

553
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,170
不是那種夢
What... oh,no... No that I wouldn't.

554
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,520
我只是
I.. It's just...

555
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,310
我待會兒再打給你  寶貝
I'll call you back in a minute honey.

556
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,720

什麼考試
For what?

559
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,610
心理學  今早有個大測驗
Psych. And I got a big test this morning,

560
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,980
那我繼續看了
so I should get back to it.

561
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,370
我能借支筆嗎
Can I borrow a pen?

562
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,820
當然
Yeah,sure.

563
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,420
夥計  這樣可不禮貌
Woooh! Hey,that's not cool man!

564
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,140
-夥計  你的包可真亂  -你幹什麼
- Man... Your bag is a mess. - What you doing man?

565
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,060
跟我的包一樣亂
Never find what I am looking for,

566
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,180
想找東西的時候總找不到
just like my bag. Just like my...

567
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,180
-你還是把包還給人家吧  -一邊弄你的交易去
- How about you let the guy have his bag back? - Finish your deal!

568
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,310
別多管閒事  不然有你好看
Stay out of this tough guy or doesn't end well for you.

569
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,670
你沒權這麼做
You can't do that.

570
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,230
什麼都沒找到  什麼都沒有
What am I doing? What am I doing here?

571
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,800
我去  媽逼的
Jesus. Dick.

572
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,640
C-o-c-n
C-o-c-n.

573
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,090
沃爾特·裏德  部隊醫療中心

574
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,400
打擾了  女士  你好

00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,390
不用借  我可以付你錢
I don't even have to borrow,I can pay you for it.

-肖恩  說句話  -上尉

斯蒂文斯上尉
Captain Stevens,

622
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,900
我是柯琳·戈德溫上尉
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

623
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,320
這裏是圍城  你沒事了
You're with operation Beleaguered Castle. You are safe.

624
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,160
告訴我你看見了什麼
Now,can you tell me what you see?

Do you copy,we're taking a lot of RPG fire here.

628
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,700
我死了嗎
Am I dead?

629
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,070
一個廣播節目說一架直升機在鄉村墜毀
A radio listing is saying that

630
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,100
我死在裏面了
I died in a helicopter crash in country,

631
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,600
我父親替我接受了勳章
and my father received a medal for me.

632
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,090
你的情況與此任務無關
Your condition is not the issue here

633
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,620
你應該盡力阻止接下來的爆炸
You need to focus on preventing any subsequent attacks.

634
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,460
其他的都無關緊要
Everything else is irrelevant.

635
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,440
新聞說我死了  這無關緊要嗎
News report saying that I am dead is irrelevant?

636
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,370
在火車設彈人
Until the person or persons

637
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,370
被抓到之前  是的
who blew up that train are in custody... yes!

638
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,880
戈德溫
Goodwin.

639
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,740
將心比心  我是死了嗎
One soldier to another. Am I dead?

640
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,640
你大腦的一部分仍在運作
Part of your brain remains activated.

641
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:44,150
那我身體的其它部分呢
What about the rest of me?

642
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,160
我的手腳仍然可以動
I can see my hands and my feet. They still move.

643
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,290
它們只是表象
They're a manifestation.

644
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,120
是你的主觀想像
They're just your way of making sense of all this.

645
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,880
你是說  這一切都是我的想像嗎
So..What are you saying? Are you saying that I am imagining this?

646
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
我想像...自己仍然
I'm imagining that ...I am still alive,

647
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,530
活在這機艙裏嗎
that I am in this capsule?

648
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,290
第四安培數下降
We have fourth amp dropping.

649
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,740
上尉  裏面怎麼了
Captain,what just happened?

650
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,570
能問你個問題嗎
Can I ask you a question?

651
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,100
這個機艙也只是個表象
The capsule is a manifestation as well.

652
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,370
-我在哪兒  -這是機密
- Where am I? - That's classified.

653
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,300
操你媽的
Fuck you!

654
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,410
上尉  我不能體會你現在的心情
Captain,I can not imagine what you must be feeling right now,

655
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,330
但我們必須馬上
but if are to prevent a second attack,

656
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,850
送你回去阻止第二場爆炸
we need to send you back immediately.

657
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,040
上尉  你在源代碼中時
And Captain,you cannot deviate from the mission

658
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,760
不能分心想任務以外的事情  甚至...
while inside the Source Code. Even to investigate your...

659
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,850
不能去深究自己發生了什麼事
Even to investigate what happened to you.

660
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,800
這個終端的程序一致連續  由不得你亂攪和
There is only one continuum on this end and it can't be unsettled.

661
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,900
我剛還真就攪和了  我從車上給你打電話了
Well,you know,I did unsettle it. I called you from the train.

662
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,400
就在爆炸之前
Just before the explosion,

663
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,160
今早7點46分  他們呼叫了你...
so 7:46 this morning they paged you with a call...

664
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,330
你可能在火車上給我打了電話
You may have made that call from the train,

665
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,250
但我在這收不到
but I would never receive it here.

666
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,320
這是不同的世界  上尉
It's a different reality,Captain.

667
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,410
就算電話接通了
If the call even went through it would be

668
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,260
接電話的也是一個完全不同的我
received by a different me entirely.

669
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,750
這你聽起來可能很費解
This may be difficult for you to hear,

670
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,890
但你就是時鐘上的指針
but you are a hand on a clock,understand?

671
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,050
我們給你上了發條  你就開始轉動
We set you,you move forward.

672
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,640
再上一次發條  你又開始轉動
We reset you,you move again.

673
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,810
你的作用就體現在此
And that represents the entirety of your function here.

674
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,880
下次我要給你寄個披薩
You know what,next time,I'll send you a pizza.

675
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,630
我倒要看看  這有沒有用
I see,if that makes an impression.

676
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,330
你無法在源代碼中
You cannot alter the continuum

677
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,300
改變現實的連續性
of this reality from within the Source Code.

678
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,350
你弄的這玩意肯定是違法的
This can't be legal what you are doing.

679
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,310
實際上  
In fact,

680
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,890
你大腦的使用權和整個項目
your acquisition by this program as well as the program itself,

681
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,720
都通過了軍事法庭的審核
has been reviewed and sanctioned by a military court.

682
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,790
許多士兵都會認為
You know,many soldiers would

683
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,590
執行這任務比死了要好
find this preferable to death.

684
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,480
因為有機會繼續為國家效力
The opportunity to continue serving their country.

685
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,170
長官
Have you....

686
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,510
你到底經歷過真刀真槍的戰鬥嗎
Have you spent much time in battle,sir?

687
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,900
這無關緊要
That's immaterial.

688
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,990
我的戰友們都會認為
Any soldier I've ever served with

689
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,880
為國效力  死一次就夠了
could say that one death is service enough.

690
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,220
好吧  只要你完成了任務  我就答應你的要求
Fine,you can have that in return for completing this mission.

691
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:44,400
-什麼要求  -給你你想要的
- Wha... Have what? - I'll give you what you want...

692
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,130
終結你的服役  讓你安息
Terminate your service,let you die.

693
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:51,990
浪費太多時間了
This is taking too long,

694
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,600
你對他太仁慈  現在起不許休息了
you've been to easy on him. No more rest periods.

695
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,840
我相信  我們會找到跟你受過類似傷
I am certain,we can find other service men with wounds

696
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,260
但卻把執行此任務
similar to yours who'll

697
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,330
視為無上榮耀的士兵
consider being a part of this program an honor.

698
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,150
不不  等等  什麼
No,no,no,no,no. Wait,wait. What?

699
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:12,270
送他回去  驅動通電
Send him back. Charge the drivers.

700
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,860
斯蒂文斯上尉
And Captain Stevens,

701
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,780
我得提醒你 這可不只是為了你自己
I'd like you to remember that it's not only about you,

702
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,090
更是為了外面兩千萬美國人
but it's also about 2 million real world Americans.

703
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,200
你可能不珍惜你的命
Now you may not value your own life,

704
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,990
但我請你珍惜他們的生命
I do however ask that you value theirs.

705
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:32,370
建議
Advice....

706
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,370
老頭
Hey Grandpa.....

707
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,540
冷靜下來  你回來了
Calm yourself,you're back.

708
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,220
找到設彈人了嗎
Did you find the bomber?

709
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,020
車上有幾百個人
There... are hundreds of people on that train.

710
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,350
那就一個一個地去檢查
Well,then check them out one by one.

711
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,930
你怎樣對他們都無所謂  反正他們都死了
Doesn't matter what you do to them,they're already dead.

712
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,990
有必要的話  就拿槍殺了他們
Get to that gun and shoot them all if you have to,

713
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,460
但是一定要搞到有用的情報
but get us some usable intel.

714
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,640
不  等等
No! No,wait!

715
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,030
在找到設彈人之前  你必須反覆穿越
We have to keep doing this,until you find the bomber.

716
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,360
擺脫  我一直在努力
Please,I am trying,I am trying

717
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,820
誰是投彈手
Who is the bomber?

718
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,730
我在努力
I am trying.

719
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,350
抱歉  上尉  我知道你很累
I am sorry,Captain. I know you are exhausted

720
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,050
我們也都很沮喪  但我們輸不起
and we are all frustrated,but we can not fail.

721
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:36,380
你做得到的
You can do this.

722
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,870
-我做不到  -你可以
- I can't,I can't. - Yes,you can.

723
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,480
你天生就是英雄  即使你父親也這樣想
You are a born hero,son. Even your father thinks so.

724

01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,180
這裏才是真實世界
This is real life,here.

872
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,460
跟掛掉的飛行員通話也叫真實嗎
The one where you talking to a dead helicopter pilot?

873
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,810
這個程序的初衷不是為了改變過去
The program wasn't designed to alter the past,

874
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,140
而是左右未來  這你已經做到了這點
it was designed to affect the future. And you have done that.

875
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,940
我搞砸了點事情  上尉
I missed something,Captain.

876
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,580
那列車不該爆炸
That train shouldn't have blown up.

877
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,470
肯定還有另一個引爆器
There must have been a second detonator.

878
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,210
備用的  我沒發現
Something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.

879
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,920
這是電腦程序  上尉
It's a computer program,Captain.

880
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,840
車上的姑娘  還有其他人  都已經死了
The girl on the train,all the others,they're lost.

881
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,110
我很抱歉
I am sorry about that.

882
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,370
我知道的
I get it. I get it.

883
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,510
量子物理  寓式積分
I know,quantum physics,parable calculus.

884
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,600
但你錯了  戈德溫  大錯特錯
You're wrong,Goodwin. You're just plain wrong.

885
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:47,610
上尉  克莉絲汀娜已經死了
Captain,Christina is dead.

886
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,720
她有機會活下去的
She doesn't have to be,Ma'm.

887
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,040
我問問拉特裏奇
I'll ask Rutledge.

888
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:56,540
我求求你
I'm asking you.

889
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:04,570
求你...把我...送...
I'm asking you..... Just..... send me.....

890
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:11,820
送我回去  終止我的生命

891
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,270
只要八分鐘而已  戈德溫

892
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,880
上尉
Captain.

893
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,890
決定權在你
It's your choice.

894
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,700
這段源代碼結束時我會關閉生命維持系統
At the end of this Source Code I'll terminate your life support.

895
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,970
你再也不會回來了
There willl be no coming back.

896
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,870
我一定能拯救她  戈德溫
I am gonna save her,Goodwin!

897
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,360
我一定能拯救她  戈德溫

898
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,110
很榮幸為你效勞  上尉
It was an honor,Captain.

899
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,520

901
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,040
我採納了你的建議
I took your advice.

902
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,590
你要去印度當老師了
You're gonna move to India and become a Guru.

903
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,210
當心  女士
Careful,ma'm.

904
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,850
沒錯  我要在深山裏找尋自我
Yeah,I am gonna go find myself in the mountains.

905
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,010
走之前  你也許可以跟我喝杯咖啡
Well maybe you have a cup of coffee with me before you go.

906
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,370
好啊  我很想做那個前青春期測試
Yeah,I like to do that pre-teen test.

907

好的

要不今天做吧
Let's do it today.

909
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,180
把班翹掉  布萊恩可以找別的助手
Let's just skip work. Bryan can find someone else to assist him.

910
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,250
-你知道嗎  -知道什麼
- You know what? - What?

911
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,190
我感覺很棒
I feel really good.

912
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,330
為什麼
Why?

913
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,750
因為就你這一杯咖啡
Cause I have been waiting for weeks

914
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,590
我都等好幾個星期了
for you to ask me for a coffee.

915
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,880
您的票
Ticket.

916
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:45,930

我就知道他是個悶騷子
I knew he was a keeper.

Beautiful day.

921
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:42,000
-您的票  -不好意思  對不起
- Ticket. - Oh,I am sorry. Sorry.

922
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,600
你相信國防部嗎
You trust the DOD?

923
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,740
他們掌管財政大權
They got the finances.

924
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,260
是啊  沒錯  如果我們拿到資金
Yeah,well sure. Look,if we get the funding.

925
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,230
我向你保證  我們在年底前
I guarantee you... we can have at least....

926
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,560
至少會有八個源代碼計劃在正常運轉
8 Source Code projects up and running by the end of the year.

927
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,340
-真會有那麼多嗎  -說不定會更多

930
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,010
是啊  項目大獲全勝
Yes,a true victory for the program.

931
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,790
-是我們共同的勝利  -以後再聊
- A great victory for us all. - We'll talk soon.

932
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:17,510
激動人心的時刻到了
So...... exciting times.

933
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,440
啟動SC-1記憶移除程序
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1

934
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,600
開始處理數據
and start crunching the data.

935
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,300
先生
...Sir...

936
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:29,370
我們不是跟斯蒂文斯上尉說好了
We,we.... we told Captain Stevens,

937
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,010
讓他安息的嗎
that we were gonna let him die.

938
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:35,510
讓他死  他剛剛救下了無數條生命
Let him die? He just saved millions of lives today.

939
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,480
有了他  以後能避免多少災難
How many other disasters might he avert down the line?

940
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,740
而且據我們所知  他可能
For all we know,he may be

941
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,490
是能讓這套系統運行的唯一人選
the only candidate with which the system works.

942
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:50,770
所以  清除他的記憶  初始化源代碼
So,let's clear his memory and reinitialize Source Code.

943
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,450
好嗎
Shall we?

944
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,750
遵命
Yes,sir.

945
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,790
不好意思  我...
Sorry,I just....

946
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,870
德裏克  你不在這站下呀
Hey Derek,this isn't your stop.

947
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,530
先生  你把這個掉了
Hey Mr. You dropped this.

948
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,810
過來  到後面來
Come on,back here.

949
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,650
德裏克
Derek.

950
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:53,800
都結束了
It's over.

951
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:56,890
明白嗎
Do you understand?

952
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,650
我叫德裏克·弗羅斯特
Hey,my name is Derek Frost.

953
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,160
我在一輛白色貨車中安置了一個核裝置
I planted a nuclear device in a white van,

954
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,160
車停在格倫布魯克站的CCR停車場
parked in a Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot

955
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,590
現在我被銬在944 CCR列車的扶手上
right now I am handcuffed to a pole

956
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,020
列車正駛往芝加哥聯合站
on the 944 CCR train,headed to Chicago Union Station.

957
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,430
我是個變態的可憐蟲
I am a sick and pathetic human being.

958
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,200
我渴望一段漫長的監獄之旅
And I need to be locked away for a very long time.

959
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,680
好了
Ok.

960
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:32,100
德裏克  今天你是夷不平這個世界了
Derek,there's no more burying the world in rubble today.

961
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,520
不介意我借用一下吧
You mind if I borrow this?

962
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:44,200
上尉  我們哥幾個要去慶祝一下
Captain,some of the guys and I are gonna go celebrate.

963
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,960
他們讓我啟動記憶清除程序  上尉
And.... they want me to initiate the memory wipe,Captain.

964
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:22,910
你好  上尉
Hello,Captain.

965
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,990
-你好  -是唐納德·斯蒂文斯嗎

966
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:36,870

967
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,770

I served with your son,Colter.

969
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,470
天哪
Oh boy...

970
01:15:53,660 --> 01:16:00,360
很抱歉這麼久才打電話給你
It's a..... I am sorry it has taken me so long to.... call you.

971
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,050
有時候自己需要一些時間  
Sometimes it just takes a while

972
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,980
才能找到最想說的話
to figure out what you wanna say,you know.

973
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,600
別太勉強自己
Ah,don't be too hard on yourself...

974
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,490
打這個電話並不容易
It's not an easy call to make.

975
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,220
先生  您過得還好嗎
How are you doing,Sir?

976
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:24,880
運回來的只有些骨灰
All that came back was some ash.

977
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,570
很難相信那就是他
It's hard to believe that it was him.

978
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,740
你有多瞭解他
How well did you know him?

979
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,680
他犧牲的時候我在場  他說...
I was there when he died,Sir. He said...

980
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:56,720
你們的最後一次談話  言辭很激烈...
that the last time that you guys talked,ehm... was tough ....and

981
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,450
他想說聲對不起
he wanted to say that he was sorry.

982
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,180
我只想讓他平安回來
I just wanted him back.

983
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,150
我很愛他
I loved him so much.

-真希望能親口告訴他  -他知道的
- I wish I could have told him that. - He knows it.

985
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,480
保重  斯蒂文斯先生
Take care,Mr. Stevens.

986
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,010
-你沒事吧  -沒事
- You ok? - Yeah.

987
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,610
-拯救世界了  -差不多吧
- Saved the world? - Sorta.

988
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,820
剛說到哪兒了
So,where were we?

989
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,030
去喝咖啡
Getting some coffee.

990
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,570
這是拉特裏奇博士
Dr. Rutledge?

991
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:48,610
什麼
What?

992
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,290
該死
Shit!

993
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:03,010
這有什麼難的  我是經商的好嗎
What is too hard about it? I run a business,ok?

994
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:04,730
要麼按時完成工作  要麼捲鋪蓋滾蛋
Everything moves on time or people get fired.

995
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,100
現實世界就是這麼殘酷
That's how it works in the real world.

996
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,490
-十分鐘  -老兄
- 10 Minutes. - Hey buddy.

997
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,520
別為些瑣事汗流浹背  小心汗水逆流成河
Don't sweat the small stuff,you'll drown.

998
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,860
多謝大師指點迷津
Oh thank you for the moment of Zen,

999
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:14,980
但我又沒跟你說話
but nobody was talking to you.

1000
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:16,560
你算什麼  大喇叭廣播嗎
What do you sound,self help cds today?

1001
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,670
管好自己的事得了
Why don't you just mind your own business?

1002
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,400
保安  帶一隊人馬過來  速度
Security? Get me a detachment of MPs here. This instant!

1003
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,600
為什麼你老愛挖苦人呢  馬克思
Why are you always so bitter,Max?

1004
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,820
朋友  這世界就是如此殘酷
It's a bitter world we living my friend.

1005
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,600
你想讓我怎麼辦
What you want from me?

1006
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,760
沒必要這樣的
It doesn't have to be.

1007
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,240
我賭一百塊
I will bet you 100 dollars,

1008
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:40,120
賭你不能把車裏所有人逗笑
that you can't make all the people on this train laugh.

1009
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,450
好了
Oh right...

1010
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,980
這總共有...126塊
Actually,126 bucks.

1011
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,230
你就這麼玩兒我嗎
Is that your way of making fun of me?

1012
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:53,930
不  為了讓今天多點歡樂
No,it is to have a better day...

1013
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,400
不  我接受  手到擒來
No,no. It's good. Easiest money ever.

1014
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,180
打擾一下  朋友們  我的一個乘客朋友
Hey,I... excuse me,people. One of our fellow passengers

1015
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:06,130

1016
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:07,590
你今天怎麼了
What has just gotten into you today?

1017
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:09,270
像是變了個人
You're like a different person.

1018
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,940
-這是全新的我  -我喜歡
