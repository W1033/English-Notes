- 解除紧急状态！
- 解除！解除！

14

17
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>Disperse [dɪ'spɜːs], or we will act with force!</i>

21
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:28,458
I wondered why today was so quiet.
我想知道为什么今天这么安静。

22
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,000
Did they go to university to protest?
他们去大学抗议？

23
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,500
Enough is enough...
适可而止...

24
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,875
Spoiled bastards need to be
shipped off to Saudi Arabia.

25

Work themselves to death
努力工作至死
in the burning desert,
在炙热的沙漠中

26
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:07,083
then they'll realize, "Wow,
然后他们会意识到，“哇，
my country is great!"
我的国家很棒！”

27
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,833
How can you dash at my car?

28
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,668
If you jump out like that...

29
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,583
Run!

30
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,833
Hey, where are you going?

31
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,168

00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,918
- Stop!
- Taxi!

34
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,625
Taxi!

35
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,208
That...

36
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,125
To the hospital, quickly!

37
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,958
Mister, please go faster.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,958
The first baby takes a long time,
even after the water breaks.

39
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,458
My wife spent 12 hours
in the delivery room.

40
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,083
The first baby's always like that.

41
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,043
Hey, hey, hey...

42
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,375
No more martial law!

43
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,293
Don't tell me you're that close!

44
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:09,043
Oh, whatever.

<i>Throw out the dictatorship
and bring in democracy!</i>

46
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,458
We're here, honey.

47
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,333
My best driving ever!

48
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,875
This way.

49
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,250
Other taxi drivers won't
take pregnant women.

50
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,458
But I did, remembering my daughter's birth.

51
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,708
Thanks... Honey, where's my wallet?

52
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,958
You packed the damn bag!

53
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,293
Take another look, it must be there.

54
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:49,043
Sorry but I left my wallet behind.
Tomorrow, I promise...

55
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,918
You know how many times I heard that?

56
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,500
I could've bought a house
with all that taxi fare!

57
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:54,750
No, I promise...

58
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,583
There she goes again!

59
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,000
It's coming!

60
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,375
Hold on just a second!

61
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,083
Here's my business card.

62
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,543
Call me tomorrow, I'll pay double!
So sorry!

63
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,333
Pay me double instead?

64
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,293
Best of luck in there, okay?

65
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:12,875
Best of luck!

66
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,500
This is no place to play soccer.
Go play over there!

67
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,043
Did she go out?

68
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,875
Hey princess, sleeping already?

69
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,708
You should eat dinner.

70
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,708
Huh?

71
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,208
Who did this to you?

72
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,918
I fell down.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,125
Sang-gu, that brat!

74
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:49,083
It wasn't Sang-gu! I really fell.

75
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,293
Are you gonna lie to your dad?

76
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,208
Eun-jung! Should I hit you instead?

77
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,458
Ma'am! Sang-gu!!

78
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,750
Ah, just the person I wanted to see.

79
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,418
What do you say about this?

80
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,250
How could she do this to our precious son?

81
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,083
But she also has...

82
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,543
Really, I've never seen
a girl as wild as Eun-jung!

83
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,625
You're too soft on her
'cause her mother died!

84
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,500
That's a bit...

85
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,543
And since you're here, one more thing!

86
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,543
I've held my tongue because
I know your situation.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,333
But you owe me 100,000 won in rent!

88
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,418
I'm sorry. Ma'am, I'll...

89
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:41,000
You're 4 months late, at least
tell us when you'll pay!

90
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,208
100,000 won is a lot of money for us too.

91
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,625
Sang-gu, you're sleepy!
Must have eaten too much.

92
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,418
I don't care what my husband
says, I've had it this time.

93
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,750
And discipline your daughter, will you?

94
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,333
Breaks my heart to see my son like this.

95
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,958
Oh, I'm hungry!

96
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,083
Bean sprout soup?

97
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,375
Hey, don't fold the backs of your shoes.

98
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,918
Not answering again.

99
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:37,168
Those shoes are too small. Dinner's ready.

100
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,708
Then ask me to buy you new ones!

101
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,043
Wow, tastes great.

102
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,293
You could get married tomorrow!

103
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,000
Sang-gu's mom brought that over.

104
00:10:00,543 --> 00:10:03,750
Right, I thought it was too salty.

105
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Lift your head.

106
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,375
Dad, do we have to move?

107
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:32,583
Yup, we're gonna buy Sang-gu's house.
After I get rich.

108
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,875
So don't worry and study hard.

109
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,375
Okay?

110
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:46,583
Ouch, it stings.

111
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,250
Then why don't you listen?

112
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:53,375
What did I say? Play nice
with him, don't fight.

113
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,750
But he started it!

114
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,168
Just ignore him.

115
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:02,250
Learn to bear it. Life is
never going to be fair.

116
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,458
Want to go on a picnic this Wednesday?

117
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:12,168
No school on Buddha's Birthday.

118
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,875
You should work. More
customers on holidays.

119
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,333
Oh my, you're even worse than your mother.

120
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,375
Who do you take after, to be so sweet!

<i>Under the emergency decree

Beer and sushi again?

129
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,458
Hey Peter, how was the parliament today?

130
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,625
Same as always, nothing different.

131
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,833
This is Jürgen Hinzpeter
from ARD-nDR, Germany.

132
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,293
He's been living in Japan
for about 8 years.

133
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,000
It might be helpful to know him.

134
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,333
It's good to meet you,
Mr. Hinzpeter. David John, BBC.

135
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,918
Just call me Peter.

136
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,250
It's my first time in Japan.
Anything I should look out for?

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,168
It's comfortable.

138
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,668
That's tricky... as a journalist,

139
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,958
you shouldn't be in a place
that's too comfortable.

140
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Excuse me?

141
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,750
Nothing. Where were you based before?

142
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,293
South Korea. It's very
tense over there now.

143
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,083
I heard their government
declared martial law.

144
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,418
It's always tense there.

145
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,833
I think it's much worse this time.

146
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,708
On top of the martial law,
several opposition leaders were arrested,

147
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,918
and the universities got locked down too.

148
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,333
What else have you heard?

149
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,601
I've been trying to contact
some people I know,

150
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,875
but it's... it's almost
impossible to get through.

151
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:33,168
Since when?

152
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,668

I'm a missionary.

156
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:35,293
It's been a long time.

157
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,543
I need to get back soon.
Something doesn't feel right.

158
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,083
How bad is the situation?

159
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,958
It's been 3 days since the martial law.

160
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,125
Kim Dae-jung has been taken in,

161
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,000
and they've got Kim Young-sam
under house arrest.

162
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,500
Gwang-ju?

163
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,168
It's a city down south.

164
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:13,168
And there's no article about Gwang-ju?
No coverage, nothing?

165
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
This is the local paper from Gwang-ju.

166
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,375
They censored the whole page?

167
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,000
What exactly happened over there?

168
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,168
No one knows.

169
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,875
We got word of the first casualty
at 3 AM on the 19th...

170
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:37,250
But now,

171
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,875
even the phone lines have been cut.

172
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,125
What about the foreign press?

173
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,043
Today is Kim Jae-kyu's trial.
They all went there.

174
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,750
But the government has eyes on them.

175
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:50,958
They can't move as they wish.

176
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,875
You must be careful.

177
00:15:55,333 --> 00:16:00,293
I should go to Gwang-ju, first...

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,125
By yourself?

179
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,418
But how will you get there?

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,375
For a guy so paranoid about his car,

181
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,583
how'd you break a mirror?

182
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,543
A worthless punk. He ran
off after busting my car.

183
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,793
Why be a student if you can't
be a decent human being?

184
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,958
All right. I'll only
charge 5,000 won, okay?

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What? Just take 4,000.
I've had a rough day.

186
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:32,708
Have a heart, man! How can you be so cheap?

187
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,958
And get an inspection sometime.
The engine doesn't sound right.

188
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,458
An inspection? I inspect my car every day.

189
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,250
After 600,000 km, this
car is past retirement.

190
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,875
Easy on my car!

191
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,375
Try fixing it after it
breaks, it'll cost you more.

192
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't give me bad luck!
I'm already pissed.

193
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,543
3,000 won, then.

194
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,418
That is so unfair! You
know how much parts cost?

195
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,000
- Throw this out?
- No way. I'll use it later.

196
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,875
Leave it.

197
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,668
Dammit!

198
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,000
Hey, what're you doing?

199
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,750
God, you're pathetic.

200
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,875
Pathetic?

201
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,668
So, the kids fought again?

202
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,875
I gave Sang-gu a good scolding.

203
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,583
Ma'am! Over here!

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,375
- What?
- Another portion for us.

205
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:37,583
No, I'm fine. Never mind!

206
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,208
Why not? I said I'd pay.

207
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,043
Don't be silly, I'll pay.

208
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,293
What's the occasion?

209
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,208
Instead, lend me some money.

210
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,083
I figured. How much?

211
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,208
100,000 won. From your private stash.

212
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,168
Hey! I gave it all to my sister
As a secret wedding gift.

213
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,418
But why so much? You
paid off all your debts.

214
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,793
It's not the rent, is it?

215
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,168
Bingo!

216
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,043
My god.

217
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,168
Only you would borrow from
your landlord to pay the rent.

218
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,050
Lend it to me before you
start saying things.

219
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,668
Ma'am! Give me anything quick!

220
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,583
What's the rush?

221
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,625
We need to play cards after lunch.

222
00:18:24,043 --> 00:18:27,918
You guys play all you like.
I'm going to Kukdo Theater.

223
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,793
- Got a long distance.
- Where to?

224
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,375
Gwang-ju. We'll go now, and
be back before curfew.

225
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:36,833
Wow, you hit the jackpot. For how much?

226
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,625
100,000 won.

227
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,833
100,000 won?

228
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,918
What kind of idiot would
pay 100,000 for one day?

229
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,418
A foreigner idiot.

230
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,918
Oh, do you speak English?

231
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,708
Of course. I grew up near the U.S.
army base.

232
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,668
Damn, and foreigners pay tips!
If you add the tip...

233
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,958
You spent time abroad.
Couldn't you handle that?

234
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,793
I'm sorry! Enjoy your lunch.

235
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,583
Ma'am, discipline Sang-gu, will you?
Who does he take after?

236
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,293
And he eats too much. Takes after his mom?

237
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,668
Wait till I get that money!
I'll teach that kid some manners!

238
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:52,543
Called for a taxi?

239
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:58,875
Yes, but isn't this a private taxi?
I called a taxi company.

240
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:04,375
Ah yes, but the company's
cars are all busy.

241
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:06,000
So I volunteered...

242
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,750
Does he understand what's going on?

243
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,833
Of course. I explained everything.

244
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,293
You were told everything?

245
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,583
Yes, to Gwang-ju and back
before curfew for 100,000 won.

246
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:18,293
And you speak English?

247
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,500
Of course, of course!

248
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:24,125
Sure, I spent 5 years in Saudi Arabia,
so I speak English.

249
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't worry, don't worry! I'm Mr. Kim!

250
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,418
Together, let's go Gwang-ju.

251
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,918
Okay, nice to meet you!

252
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,958
Please get in.

253
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,083
OK, okay.

254
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:43,793
Thank you.

255
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,043
Be careful.

256
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,168
Take another taxi. This one's reserved.

257
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,418
Reserved? For where?

258
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,458
Why?

259
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:08,418
This car's going to Gwang-ju.

260
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:20,500
You Korea first time?

261
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:24,583
No. It's my second time.

262
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,708
Oh really?

263
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,250
You are where from?

264
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,250
Germany.

265
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,043
Germany, oh really?

266
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,750
My friend...

267
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,750
What's the word for that?

268
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:43,958
He went to mine coal.

269
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:48,000
I know, there are many
Korean workers in Germany.

270
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:50,250
Nurses, miners.

271
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,793
I was in Saudi, you know?

272
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:55,750
Do you know Saudi? This taxi, Saudi money.

273
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,750
I drive Saudi truck.

274
00:21:57,793 --> 00:22:01,250
Driving in that desert, shit!

275
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,418
People here don't have a damned clue!

276
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,000
Listen, how far is it to Gwang-ju?

277
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,003
I don't have much time, I
need to go there quick.

278
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:11,168
Why is he talking so fast?

279
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,668
You, fast. Huh? Slow...

280
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,625
So that I can English.

281
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,458
Slow, okay?

282
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,958
Okay. Gwang-ju, we go fast. Okay? Fast!

283
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:26,708
What's the hurry?

284
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:28,500
Gwang-ju, don't worry! Don't worry!

285
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:29,833
I'm best driver.

286
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:32,668
It's really far. Get some sleep.

287
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,000
Sleep... sleep.

288
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,833
You darling, you!

289
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,293
My recent luck's been
shit all for this day.

290
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,583
Hey hey, Gwang-ju! Gwang-ju!

291
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,125
Gwang-ju? Are we here?

292
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,958
What's this? Can we go?

293
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,083
Don't slow down, keep going!

294
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,043
Uh, yes, yes.

295
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,208
What's he shooting?

296
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,668
What picture, what camera?

297
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,708
Let's go, hurry!

298
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,125
Why so rude? If I ask
you something, answer.

299
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,333
And what's with this road?
Can I pass, or not?

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,043
What's this?

301
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,583
I'm not a reporter, you understand?

302
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,583
Huh? What?

303
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,458
I said to speak slow!

304
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,375
Are they training?

305
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,375
Stop!

306
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,125
Is this a training exercise?

307
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,583
What division?

308
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:16,125
I did my service in the 7th division.

309
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:18,168
This is a real operation. Turn back.

310
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,793
Didn't you see the sign?

311
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:25,793
My passenger's going to Gwang-ju.

312
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,500
You idiot, are you trying to die?

313
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,668
Who the hell are you?

314
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:33,918
What is he saying?

315
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,293
Is he asking me something?

316
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,583
What did he just say?

317
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,458
He said, let's go back. He made a mistake.

318
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Allegiance!

319
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:02,333
Excuse me, Driver. This
direction, also Gwang-ju?

320
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,708
No, no Gwang-ju. Now, we go Seoul.

321
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,125
Seoul?

322
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,708
What are you talking about?
I have to go to Gwang-ju.

323
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,668
That's what you think, and
it's not that I refuse.

324
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,043
Soldier say, Gwang-ju no!

325
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:25,168
Okay, you won't get paid
if you don't take me to Gwang-ju.

326
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,043
You understand?

327
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,543
What's he saying?

328
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:32,208
No Gwang-ju, no money.

329
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,250
No money?

330
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,543
Are you joking? You know
how much gas we used?

331
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,083
Soldier say no Gwang-ju!

332
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,708
We can't go there!

333
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:43,958
No Gwang-ju!

334
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,958
You what camera picture?

335
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,458
Why you Gwang-ju?

336
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Oh my god.

337
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,793
You know what, just take me to Gwang-ju.

338
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,726
That's all you should worry
about what I'm doing there.

339
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,125
It's none of your business, okay?

340
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,708
Business?

341
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,333
You businessman?

342
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:04,625
So you go to Gwang-ju?

343
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,958
Yes, Gwang-ju.

344
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:11,418
No Gwang-ju, no money.

345
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,625
Shit, am I just going to waste gas money?

346
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,793
Sir!

347
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,543
Let me ask you something.

348
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,583
Is there any back road
to Gwang-ju around here?

349
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:40,083
Nope.

350
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,250
Then, is there anyone who'd know...

351
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:47,293
What do you want there?

352
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,375
Didn't you see the soldiers?

353
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,875
You'd be better off heading back home.

354
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:57,793
Sir, if I can't get to Gwang-ju...

355
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,793
Sir, I really need to go there!

356
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:09,458
Our village foreman told us
to stay clear of Gwang-ju.

357
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:20,668
Over that there hill,
there is one back road...

358
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,043
Where is it?

359
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,043
Over there...

360
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,293
Over that side...

361
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,793
This road's gonna ruin my shocks.

362
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,083
You're lucky to have me, you know?

363
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,125
Any other driver would
be back in Seoul by now.

364
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,293
Here, no soldier!

365
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:53,958
Yeah, great. No soldier.

366
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:05,543
What's going on, for them
to block even this road?

367
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,875
Stop! Who the hell...

368
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,293
Turn back.

369
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,875
I'm just trying to earn some money...

370
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,375
You said you're a businessman?

371
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,043
Dollars, contract.

372
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,125
Contract...

373
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,750
Something like this.

374
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,458
Very very important paper!

375
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:28,750
You forgot this, okay? In Gwang-ju.

376
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,708
What?

377
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:34,250
Good day, sir! Allegiance!

378
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:35,083
Yes.

379
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,125
I'm coming from Gimpo Airport.

380
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,833
That guy is a really important businessman.

381
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:44,000
He had to miss his plane to U.S.,
and return for important papers.

382
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,668
No. Turn back!

383
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,833
Please listen.

384
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:50,583
Without those papers, we
can't export to the U.S.

385
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:53,875
I came speeding here from the
airport all out of patriotism!

386
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,958
We need to export so we can like,
get dollars! Yeah?

387
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,851
- What's wrong?
- To become a developed country...

388
00:29:58,875 --> 00:29:59,918
Hold on a sec.

389
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Listen!

390
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:05,833
If I don't get to Gwang-ju there
will be problems, big problems!

391
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,918
My boss is a very important man.

392
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:11,208
He'll be very unhappy if I don't
get back with those documents.

393
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,000
Very very unhappy! Tell him.

394
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,500
What did he say?

395
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,418
You said a hugely important...?

396
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,833
Tell him, not me.

397
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,875
Very very important paper, okay?

398
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:24,250
Very important paper.

399
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:27,958
Important man, important paper.
Big, big trouble!

400
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,043
Hey, clear a path.

401
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:43,833
But come right back.

402
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,918
It's dangerous there
because of the rioters.

403
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,083
- Rioters?
- Yes.

404
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes, we'll be back in a flash.

405
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,250
- Allegiance!
- Yes.

406
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,918
Nice job back there!

407
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:16,543
My fare.

408
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,375
100,000 won now.

409
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:23,875
I've told you, I'll pay you
once we get back to Seoul.

410
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,250
Gwang-ju dangerous.

411
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:26,333
So pay in advance.

412
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,458
First money.

413
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:30,500
No, it's "Ladies first," so...

414
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:31,918
Money first.

415
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,918
Korea business style.

416
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:36,293
Now no money, I go Seoul.

417
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,833
Your choice.

418
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,208
Go ahead and glare at me, you jerk.

419
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,000
Your choice!

420
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,333
You'll get the rest in Seoul.

421
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,043
Your choice!

422
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:05,043
What a fox. Are you copying me?

423
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,833
Still, 50,000 is nice.

424
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,500
I choice! Let's go Gwang-ju, okay?

425
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,668
Alrighty!

426
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,000
What a miser.

427
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,918
Glare at me like that and
I'll rip your eyes out.

428
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,833
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

429
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,375
Let's go Gwang-ju,

430
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:28,793
that's all I said.

431
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,168
<i>To the citizens of democratic Gwang-ju...</i>

432
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:48,625
<i>Defend Democracy to the Death!</i>

433
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,875
What's going on here?

434
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:53,125
<i>Rescind martial law!</i>

435
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:57,168
Stop the car, Driver. What does that mean?

436
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,418
Huh? What?

437
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,458
<i>To the 1980s, Decade of Hope!</i>

438
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,125
It says...

439
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,083
Hope, hope. Eight.

440
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:09,043
Ah, 80, 80. Hope.

441
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,208
Hope?

442
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,458
In the 1980s...

443
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,168
Oh, it's just some crap. Forget about it.

444
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,418
What's that?

445
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,583
Wait, stop! Pull over.

446
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,083
Hey look, it's a Seoul taxi.

447
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,793
Whoa, it's a foreigner.

448
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,293
Hi. Where are you going?

449
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,601
- What's he saying?
- Well...

450
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,875
Isn't that a camera?

451
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,833
Those university students
speak worse English than me.

452
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,543
Hey, Jae-sik! You speak
some English, right?

453
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,958
Get over here, Jae-sik.

454
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,168
Why me?

455
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:53,958
Hi.

456
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:55,293
Hi.

457
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,418
Where are you going?

458
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,583
Where are you from?

459
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,418
Germany. German broadcast, ARD.

460
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:10,043
German. Um.. Are you a reporter?

461
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,543
Yes. I am a reporter.

462
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,793
He's a reporter from
Germany, come to shoot us.

463
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,793
We'll be on the news. Great!

464
00:34:25,293 --> 00:34:27,293
Businessman, my ass.

465
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:28,976
If you're a reporter,
you should've told me!

466
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,875
He rode here in a taxi from Seoul!

467
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,083
Let's give a hand to the
taxi driver who came so far!

468
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,958
Ah well, from Seoul to here...

469
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,250
Where are you headed now?

470
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,293
...is pretty far.

471
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,208
We go to the hospital for the sick.

472
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:47,875
Can I come with you?

473
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:49,543
Yes.

474
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:50,750
I'd like to interview him.

475
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,000
He wants to interview you.

476
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,293
Wow, you're a star now!

477
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,543
Ah, I should've at least washed my face.

478
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,083
You come up too, Mister.

479
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,208
What do you mean?

480
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,918
He needs to drive his taxi.

481
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:15,833
Don't worry, don't worry.

482
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,583
I'll be right behind you.

483
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,583
Me too go!

484
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,543
Then follow us!

485
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,375
Let's go!

Oh my, taxi!

496
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,833
Give me a lift, mister!

497
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:26,083
Take a Gwang-ju taxi, granny.
This is a Seoul taxi.

498
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:30,918
Oh, jeez.

499
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,668
Granny, can you even pay the fare?

500
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,750
Who's in the hospital?

501
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,958
They said someone who looks
like my youngest son

502
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,793
was brought there after
a soldier smashed his head.

503
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,293
Is he a university student?
Does he protest?

504
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:01,418
He didn't even go to high school.

505
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:05,793
Didn't come home last night.

506
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:10,750
Then he must have been out
drinking with his friends!

507
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:13,418
He can't drink.

508
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:19,418
And those soldiers, they've gone berserk,

509
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:25,418
beating and stabbing anyone who passes by.

510
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,958
Granny, I was an army sergeant.
No soldier would ever do that.

511
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,043
Those are all just rumors, right?

512
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,208
Of course...

513
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:41,918
Then where the heck did he go?

514
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,293
No, I won't take you!

515
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,750
Go see if they need help.

516
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:07,793
Please drive. I have to rush.

517
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,293
What's your hurry?

518
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,543
You don't write a single
line in the newspaper!

519
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,875
You reporters have more
time than anyone now!

520
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,625
If reporters don't report,
why should we drive?

521
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:23,668
Gwang-ju taxi drivers must be rich,
turning down fares like that.

522
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:27,500
Ma'am.

523
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,875
Please give me a ride.

524
00:38:29,918 --> 00:38:30,958
No way.

525
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,168
Damn it!

526
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:34,375
Taxi, taxi!

527
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:37,168
No, this is a Seoul taxi.
Take a Gwang-ju taxi.

528
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,625
Go to the other side!

529
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:45,668
Oh my.

530
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,833
What a mess.

531
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,000
A high school student?

532
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:50,293
Careful!

533
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,793
Go call a doctor!

534
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,125
Doctor!

535
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,458
Doctor!

536
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:02,293
Please find my youngest son.
I beg you, please...

537
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,125
Where are you, Yong-pyo?

538
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,043
Oh, Yong-pyo! My son...

539
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,168
Are you okay?

540
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,208
Mom?

541
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:33,750
Mom!

542
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:34,918
Yong-pyo!

543
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,458
What are you doin' here?

544
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,168
Oh, you wicked boy!

545
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,875
I thought something awful happened to you.

546
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:46,750
Are you okay?

547
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:50,208
This ain't nothin' at all.
Just three stitches.

548
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,293
Are you hurt anywhere else?

549
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,500
I'm totally fine.

550
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,833
- Sir, thank you so much!
- Oh...

551
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,333
Thank you, really.

552
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,625
Mom, wear this.

553
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't know what I'd have done
without this taxi driver.

554
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:09,125
Thank you so much.

555
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,043
You got some money?

556
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:13,918
I ain't got money.

557
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,625
Never mind, you don't need to pay me.

558
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,958
See, I told you he'd be fine!

559
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,958
Wait! Are you that Seoul taxi...

560
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:24,500
You know me?

561
00:40:24,543 --> 00:40:25,543
It's you!

562
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Yong-pyo, you know him?

563
00:40:29,543 --> 00:40:31,293
- A while back, this guy...
- Hey, mister!

564
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,668
What's he doing here?

565
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,068
Do you have any idea how much
time I wasted looking for you?

566
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,375
We've been driving all
over trying to find you!

567
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:41,668
Where is my film bag?

568
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,375
Who is he to yell at my driver!

569
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,125
He ran off with this reporter's
expensive equipment.

570
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,750
What are you talking about?

571
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,458
How dare you!

572
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,333
I took what? I didn't take anything!

573
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:58,708
What's going on?

574
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,750
His...

575
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,418
Look here!

576
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,583
What's this doing here?

577
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:11,043
I don't know.

578
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,543
I really didn't know.

579
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,333
You said to follow, and then you sped off.

580
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:19,918
I don't know the roads here.
You know how hard I searched?

581
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,125
Hey mister, that ain't so.

582
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,958
People saw you take a U-turn.

583
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,793
Hey, Yong-pyo! Watch it.

584
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,543
Would he really take off
without collecting his fare?

585
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,958
Here, the other half of the fare.

586
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,500
So you just go back to Seoul.
I'm better off on my own.

587
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:40,208
What? He charged 50,000
won just to come here?

588
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,125
Actually, they agreed on 100,000,
and he already received half.

589
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:46,458
100,000 won?

590
00:41:47,668 --> 00:41:49,793
What? So he got paid and tried to run off?

591
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,043
Take this and go!

592
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,083
Just take it.

593
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:58,625
Why are you giving this guy money?

594
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,293
He's giving us all a bad name.

595
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:06,043
Taxi drivers like this need
to be taught a lesson!

596
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:09,333
Whose side are you guys on, anyway?

597
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:11,208
How dare you start shouting!

598
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,333
Bro, am I wrong?

599
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:16,833
Why don't you say something?

600
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,125
What would I say?

601
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,625
If he received his fare...

602
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,833
would he really just ditch his passenger?

603
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,543
Man, you're so wishy-washy.

604
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm not wishy-washy.

605
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,833
I'm firm when I need to be.
Don't you know me?

606
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:38,418
Hey, Seoul Driver! You'll
pay for doing that.

607
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,708
As a driver it's wrong, and
as a human being it's wrong!

608
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:45,875
How dare you talk to me that way!

609
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:51,543
I guess everything they
said about you was true!

610
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,125
Let me take a look at your license number.

611
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:56,333
What the hell are you doing?

612
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Here!

613
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:04,250
I'm not receiving anything, alright?

614
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Let's go.

615
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:30,793
College boy! Are you gonna
ride around in my car all day?

616
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:35,000
He asked me to translate...

617
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,168
Do your parents know what you're doing?

618
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,333
Why are you chewing me out?

619
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,625
Didn't you see back there?

620
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,333
Your mother must be worried sick.

621
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,083
Paying that expensive tuition, did
you go to university to protest?

622
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:54,333
You went to study, right?
Then you should study, dammit!

623
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,668
I didn't go to university to study.

624
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,210
I went to compete in the
university song contest.

625
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:12,625
Then why not spend this time
practicing your singing?

626
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,375
Mister, you don't know
what you're talking about.

627
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:20,543
You students think other
countries are as nice as ours?

628
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,458
Go to Saudi Arabia! In that hot, burning...

629
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,625
What's so great about a country
where soldiers assault you?

630
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:27,833
Then why do you keep protesting?

631
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:31,543
They keep telling you to
stop, but you won't listen!

632
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,668
How is it that this foreigner
understands better than you?

633
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:36,750
Forget it.

634
00:44:36,793 --> 00:44:38,375
Seven o'clock go Seoul, okay?

635
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,333
Okay.

636
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,500
Promise, seven o'clock!

637
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:47,668
Is he going in the right direction?

638
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:52,250
Yeah, don't worry. This
is the right direction.

639
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:55,043
We turn right here, and then we go more.

640
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There!

641
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,083
Oh my god!

642
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:01,043
Mister, you missed the right turn!

643
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:02,750
Gas, gas!

644
00:45:02,918 --> 00:45:04,625
I'm going to fill the gas tank!

645
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,625
Goddamn!

646
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:11,083
Gas...

647
00:45:17,543 --> 00:45:18,875
Stop, stop.

648
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,433
3,000 won's worth, but like a full tank.

649
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,543
Who do you think I am?

650
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,958
I'm not that kind of person!

651
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,793
What did I just say?

652
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,934
You're not that kind of person.

653
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,875
No, I said 3,000 won.

654
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,458
- Right?
- Yes.

655
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:44,958
Stop pumping! What, are you crazy?

656
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,168
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

657
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,875
I asked for 3,000 won's worth.
3,000 won only!

658
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:51,918
What?

659
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,958
You think I'm gonna pay more?

660
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,375
I may be an out-of-towner,
but this is outrageous!

661
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:58,625
I'm only gonna pay 3,000 won.

662
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:00,833
Look at this guy.

663
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,043
What are you so angry about,

664
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:07,708
me giving you a bit more gas
when it's all free anyway.

665
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:12,418
If I filled it full, you'd
have me by the throat.

666
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:14,708
Free?

667
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,875
Did you think everyone in
Gwang-ju was just like you?

668
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,083
Ouch!

669
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:30,418
Why didn't you say it's free?
I'd have filled the tank full.

670
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:34,500
Then fill it before you head back to Seoul.

671
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,208
Of course! The gas fare to Seoul is costly.

672
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:39,583
But why is it free?

673
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,333
You saw that taxi at the hospital?

674
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,208
Taxi drivers have one helluva
of a job these days.

675
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,000
Some were arrested for
transporting wounded people.

676
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:51,708
What's wrong about that?
You can't choose who you take.

677
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,168
That's my point.

678
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:56,750
We didn't do anything wrong
to be suffering like this.

679
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:04,793
<i>Gwang-ju citizens, to
the Provincial Office!</i>

680
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,168
<i>Drive out the martial law soldiers!</i>

681
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:14,000
That way, mister. Over there.

682
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,293
<i>Citizens of Gwang-ju! We're
all in this together!</i>

683
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,875
<i>Drive out the soldiers!</i>

684
00:47:23,543 --> 00:47:27,333
<i>Drive them out and protect our city!</i>

685
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,168
<i>Citizens of Gwang-ju!
Let's all take action!</i>

686
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:41,168
Coming through! News reporter here!

687
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:47,333
All the way from Seoul to
report, so please make way.

688
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:48,958
Thank you, thanks!

689
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,458
That's a reporter!

690
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,918
A foreigner?

691
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,958
Thank you!

692
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,875
Flew all the way here?

693
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,000
Make way, people!

694
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,583
Best to set out on a full stomach.
Have some.

695
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,958
What's this? Thank you.

696
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,375
- Hungry? Try one.
- Thank you.

697
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:21,583
- Is it okay to take this?
- We already ate!

698
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,208
Thanks so much!

699
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,918
Thanks to you, too!

700
00:48:52,043 --> 00:48:55,250
Mister, we'll be back in no time.
Why bother?

701
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,793
If my car gets scratched,
are you gonna pay for it?

702
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,458
Hey!

703
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:16,543
Hello? Where are you from?

704
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:19,543
ARD Germany. My name is Peter.

705
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,708
I'm Choi, a local reporter.
How did you get here?

706
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,668
I heard all the roads to
Gwang-ju are blocked.

707
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:27,875
I came by taxi.

708
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,543
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

709
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,668
We'd rather die standing
than live on our knees!

710
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,418
We fight for justice!

711
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,875
<i>Afternoon of May 20,
1980 Geumnam Street, Gwang-ju</i>

712
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,833
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

713
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:57,583
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

714
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:59,958
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

715
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,208
Can you hold this?

716
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,668
Yeah, okay, sure.

717
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,000
What a jerk.

718
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:31,083
Wow, Jeolla Province really
does have the best food.

719
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,168
Looks simple, but tastes great.

720
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:35,543
The seasoning is perfect!

721
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:36,625
Be very careful.

722
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:41,500
The Korean press is not allowed here,
and foreign press is not welcome.

723
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:45,625
If they find you are here, the
government will hunt you down.

724
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,000
And the people helping you.

725
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,918
What, you want one?

726
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,918
Have a bite. Nothing's happening there.

727
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:01,043
No, thank you.

728
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,668
Why so serious all of a sudden?

729
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:04,918
It's nothing.

730
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,708
I have to join them.

731
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,458
Don't get involved, stay here.

732
00:52:15,918 --> 00:52:17,668
How can I just watch?

733
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:19,793
What difference will it make?

734
00:52:20,418 --> 00:52:21,875
Okay. Let's get down there.

735
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:23,750
Where? There?

736
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:26,625
No, no, no, here stay. There danger.

737
00:52:26,668 --> 00:52:27,668
Here safe.

738
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:29,125
You stay, we go down.

739
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,293
That guy's just shooting from up here, too.

740
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:32,833
Where are you going?

741
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:44,293
What's going on?

742
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:53,458
Drive out Chun Doo-hwan!

743
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,875
Danger, danger.

744
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:06,168
If you're gonna shoot, do it from there.

745
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,918
It's too dangerous here.

746
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,833
Let's go, will you?

747
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:15,208
Are you okay?

748
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,250
Sorry, sorry!

749
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,644
What the hell is wrong with you?

750
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:20,625
That's why I said, it's too dangerous here!

751
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,418
- Let's go.
- Don't touch!

752
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,793
Mister, the soldiers have gone crazy.

753
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,625
Hurry up and run!

754
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:16,168
Damned commie needs to be taught a lesson!

755
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,208
Get rid of him!

756
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:23,168
Hey, who's that?

757
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,250
Get him.

758
00:54:25,418 --> 00:54:29,125
Do you have a death wish? We need to go!

759
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:38,500
Mister, this way! This way!

760
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,625
Over here!

761
00:54:39,668 --> 00:54:40,668
Hurry!

762
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,043
Huh? Isn't she...?

763
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:24,543
Mister!

764
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:32,500
Mister, hurry up!

765
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,375
That's why I kept saying danger!

766
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,668
Is that thing expensive?

767
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:12,043
I've never seen one before.
Should I ask him?

768
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,083
No, don't ask.

769
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
What? It wasn't my fault.

770
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:26,000
But why were those
soldiers acting that way?

771
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:30,625
Beating and chasing people
who weren't doing anything.

772
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:35,208
I don't know either. We
just don't know why.

773
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:38,375
Oh god, look at the time.

774
00:56:38,543 --> 00:56:40,208
Hey! Let's go Seoul.

775
00:56:41,668 --> 00:56:43,583
Yeah, okay. Let's go back to Seoul.

776
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:44,625
Okay, okay.

777
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,708
Then, what about you? We're going to Seoul.

778
00:56:48,418 --> 00:56:52,043
Yes, of course. Then let me off up there.

779
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,125
- Okay.
- Thanks.

780
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,708
Please promise me.

781
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,500
You have to show our news.

782
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:11,750
Once this footage airs,
the entire world will be watching.

783
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:13,750
You are not alone.

784
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,125
Thank you so much.

785
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:27,043
Sir, have a safe trip back.

786
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:28,918
Wait, kid!

787
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,458
What's your name?

788
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,543
Jae-sik. Gu Jae-sik.

789
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:37,500
Gu Jae-sik... Practice hard, okay?

790
00:57:37,543 --> 00:57:39,250
I'll watch your song contest on TV.

791
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:41,875
Okay.

792
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:45,793
Have a safe trip.

793
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:06,543
Come on, not again.

794
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:16,668
Did it break down?

795
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:19,168
What happened?

796
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,375
Isn't that...?

797
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:50,750
I told you it was him! The Seoul driver.

798
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,125
You were right.

799
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:53,208
Car's broken?

800
00:58:53,668 --> 00:58:55,418
That's bad.

801
00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:57,875
Man, the repair shop's closed.

802
00:58:57,918 --> 00:58:59,500
- Sure is.
- Yeah.

803
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:19,500
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

804
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,668
Wow!

805
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,833
Is this your daughter?

806
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,918
Whoa, she's so cute!

807
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:43,293
You've got hidden talents!
And your wife is pretty too.

808
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,583
What a relief she took after
her mother instead of...

809
00:59:50,375 --> 00:59:53,418
His daughter, huh? Pretty, isn't it?

810
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,583
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

811
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,708
No touch!

812
01:00:02,043 --> 01:00:02,958
You ready?

813
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,168
- Yeah, just a sec.
- Okay.

814
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:06,125
Ready. Try starting it!

815
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:07,500
Give it a go.

816
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,375
This car already ran over 600,000 km!

817
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,708
How'd you drive all the way here?

818
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,625
- The transmission is too old.
- Need to change the starter?

819
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,793
That's a bummer.

820
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,125
I heard the repair shop's all out of parts.

821
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:38,793
What about parts from another car?
He can have mine.

822
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:44,708
I changed my starter recently,
so better switch with mine.

823
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,293
Then, leave it here for now.

824
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:51,543
I'll find a way to make
it run a short distance.

825
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,875
How long will it take?

826
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,168
I need to be in Seoul before the curfew.

827
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,833
- It'll take at least 2 hours.
- Yeah.

828
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:01,000
Better leave for Seoul tomorrow.

829
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:03,168
Curfew here is 9 o'clock.

830
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:05,418
You don't want to be out past curfew.

831
01:01:06,418 --> 01:01:08,168
- Is there a phone somewhere?
- What for?

832
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:11,125
Those bastards have cut
all the phone lines.

833
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,168
What?

834
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,043
Isn't there any way? I need to call home.

835
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,543
What're you so worried about?

836
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,168
If a man's out working, he
can stay out a night or two.

837
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:28,875
My daughter's home alone.
And she's only 11.

838
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,833
Then where's her mom?

839
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:31,833
What?

840
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,333
Oh, that poor thing.

841
01:01:34,043 --> 01:01:35,958
Too young to be alone...

842
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:40,625
Oh my.

843
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,083
Mr. Kim, if it's about money,
let me pay for the repairs.

844
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,000
You bastard, did I ask you for money?

845
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:57,625
You knew everything, right?

846
01:01:57,668 --> 01:01:59,250
Danger, you knew it!

847
01:01:59,293 --> 01:02:00,375
Why are you yelling at me?

848
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:01,934
It's not my fault your car broke down.

849
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:04,038
And you knew exactly that
it would be dangerous here!

850
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,668
What's this prick saying?

851
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:09,583
Mister, calm down! He
says you knew the danger.

852
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,625
Bullshit! Like hell I did!

853
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:14,918
And why do you keep taking
this foreigner's side, huh?

854
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,208
What?

855
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:17,833
Just take the money.

856
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,793
Take the money. Take the money, here.

857
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,583
Get that away from me!

858
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,625
Get it away!

859
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,125
Oh my.

860
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,250
Just stop it!

861
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,043
Just calm down, stop it!

862
01:02:36,793 --> 01:02:38,793
My, oh my...

863
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:01,418
His young daughter at home alone.

864
01:03:01,918 --> 01:03:05,083
But he can't go back to Seoul.
He cannot call.

865
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,543
Jürgen Hinzpeter, Asia Correspondent
for Germany's public broadcaster.

866
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,418
He came in from Japan.

867
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,958
What are those assholes
in the security service doing?

868
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,793
He entered without registering as
a reporter, so they missed him.

869
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,918
He declared himself a missionary.

870
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:33,708
He seems to have planned the whole thing.

871
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:38,625
He's using a Seoul taxi,
so we'll find him soon.

872
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,833
So that's where you live...
the corner house?

873
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:43,125
Yes, next to it.

874
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,293
We're almost here.

875
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:53,375
Come on, hurry.

876
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,208
Honey? I'm home!

877
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,125
Dad!

878
01:04:02,293 --> 01:04:04,875
Goodness, why are you back so late?

879
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:06,333
There was a lot going on.

880
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,918
Did you stay up waiting for Daddy?

881
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,583
Who are they?

882
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,083
It's a long story. Can you make us dinner?

883
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:19,333
- Yes, but not much to eat.
- Fine with just kimchi.

884
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,875
Come on, let's go in. Please...

885
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:25,958
It's okay if we have kimchi...

886
01:04:26,793 --> 01:04:28,043
Get in!

887
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,543
Oh, my!

888
01:04:37,543 --> 01:04:40,750
Is this all we've got for
such important guests?

889
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:49,458
Don't worry. Your neighbor will
look after your daughter.

890
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:53,293
You can call her on the
way tomorrow morning.

891
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:54,793
Yes.

892
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,708
Dad, I'm hungry.

893
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,583
Oh, go ahead and eat. You're hungry?

894
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:03,918
Try this first. My wife made it.

895
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:07,375
It's crisp, slightly bitter,
but with a real kick...

896
01:05:07,418 --> 01:05:10,418
Not sure if it's your
style, but please try.

897
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:11,750
Give it a try.

898
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,333
That's hot!

899
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:19,125
This is spicy, hot.

900
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:21,458
Oh, not a problem. I can handle spicy.

901
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:28,083
Wow, he eats well.

902
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,668
Oh my god. This is a shock.

903
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:31,918
Wasser!

904
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,000
- What?
- Water!

905
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,875
Too spicy for him!

906
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:41,500
Hot!

907
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:44,668
No wonder. He ate it too easy.

908
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,250
What are you laughing for?

909
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,668
You come to a foreign country,
break a camera, eat kimchi.

910
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,543
You've been through a lot, too.

911
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:00,708
Why'd you come here?

912
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:02,125
Why you come here?

913
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,293
Reporter.

914
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:06,208
Was that English?

915
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,793
Seoul drivers speak English?

916
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,083
I'm a reporter.

917
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,918
Reporters go wherever there is news.

918
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,500
Then try translating what he just said.

919
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:25,168
I'm a reporter here for the
news something like that...

920
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:27,875
Is that right?

921
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:29,418
Yes.

922
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:34,250
You're amazing. I never would've guessed!

923
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:36,043
Ah...

924
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:38,625
Why you become a reporter?

925
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:43,375
What's that, a poker card?
I used to play, too...

926
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,418
Not that, money. He means money.

927
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,793
He means he did it because of the money?

928
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,083
Yes.

929
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:53,375
Where do you spend your money?

930
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:01,875
A hole in your sock.

931
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,583
He acts like such a big shot,
but I guess he's not.

932
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:09,500
How can you be worse off
than a widower like me?

933
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,543
<i>Martial Law Soldiers
Massacre Civilians in Gwang-ju</i>

934
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,458
Now that's a real newspaper!

935
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:27,375
There's no turning back after this.
So if anyone...

936
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,168
Are you the only reporter here?

937
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:31,668
We've all made up our minds.

938
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:35,293
Open the door!

939
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,000
Are you trying to close us down?

940
01:07:57,043 --> 01:08:01,250
But Chief! We're reporters, aren't we?

941
01:08:01,293 --> 01:08:05,333
Shouldn't we at least
try to tell the people

942
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:10,000
what's happening here and why?

943
01:08:10,043 --> 01:08:12,043
What will happen then?

944
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:17,125
They will shut us down,
and drag us all off!

945
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:19,418
Come on, get them out!

946
01:08:21,418 --> 01:08:23,083
Let go! Chief! Chief!

947
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:30,833
Will this stop bullets?

948
01:08:31,543 --> 01:08:35,375
Of course not. It's to cover the lights.

949
01:08:35,418 --> 01:08:36,500
Right.

950
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:38,958
It's time for evening news.

951
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:43,458
Why bother watching useless crap?

952
01:08:43,793 --> 01:08:46,958
Who knows, maybe they'll
say something today.

953
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:49,833
I doubt it...

954
01:08:52,793 --> 01:08:54,226
- <i>The disturbance in Gwang-ju...</i>
- It's on.

955
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,918
<i>is not yet contained...</i>

956
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:58,000
- Have some fruit.
- Hey, quiet!

957
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:03,750
<i>...with student radicals and
gangsters gathering in Gwang-ju</i>

958
01:09:03,793 --> 01:09:08,125
<i>and spreading groundless rumors.</i>

959
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:12,333
<i>To date, 1 civilian has been killed,
and 5 members of the military...</i>

960
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:14,500
Those fuckers!

961
01:09:14,543 --> 01:09:15,543
Honey!

962
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:19,043
How can they say that?
So many people died today!

963
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:21,875
Is the news just allowed to lie like that?

964
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,375
Why did we have to watch that crap?

965
01:09:25,543 --> 01:09:27,583
God that sets me off!

966
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:30,333
That's not true.

967
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:37,418
As soon as I get back to Japan,
my footage will hit the news.

968
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,458
The whole world will see.

969
01:09:42,418 --> 01:09:45,168
Mr. Kim will take me back
to the airport, and...

970
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:52,250
Anyhow without him, I would
have never made it to Gwang-ju.

971
01:09:56,208 --> 01:10:00,458
He can broadcast it when he gets
to Japan, with Mr. Kim's help.

972
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:06,458
And Mr. Kim also helped him get pass
the soldiers blocking the roads.

973
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,543
You're amazing. Both of you.

974
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,583
Well, a driver has to go
where the customer says.

975
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,583
Don't worry, don't worry.

976
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,833
I'll take you right to
the airport tomorrow.

977
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,250
Airport, okay?

978
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:25,625
By the sound of it, I should
plead to both of you...

979
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,458
Please make this work.

980
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:31,958
I'd beg you on my knees, really!

981
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:35,000
No, I'm really good at that.

982
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,293
On my knees!

983
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,333
Forget that.

984
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,958
Sing us a song instead.
He's entering a song contest.

985
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,918
We'll judge if you deserve
a prize, so sing!

986
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,750
- Oh, no way!
- Please.

987
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:50,583
I do guitar, not vocals.

988
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,458
What's the difference?

989
01:10:53,793 --> 01:10:55,043
Give him a hand!

990
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,918
What should I do?

991
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:12,875
Wow, looking good!

992
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,793

♪ leave me like this? ♪

993
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,208
♪ What can I do to go on ♪
♪ living without you? ♪

994
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,750
What? Why ring the gong?

995
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:39,043
Students may protest against
you, to stop you from singing.

996
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:43,043
I told you, I play guitar!
But I'm not that bad!

997
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,168
I shouldn't have asked him to sing.

998
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:46,583
Is that a new song?

999
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,875
I guess I'm no good.

1000
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,500
You're really not a singer.

1001
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,793
But there's something striking about him.

1002
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,543
See, I told you!

1003
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,293
Oh, my. He looks just like your brother.

1004
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:09,958
- That's right!
- Yes, they're similar!

1005
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,833
- You mean Sang-chul?
- Yeah.

1006
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,125
Who?

1007
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,793
Right, why didn't I see it before?

1008
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,918
I have a younger brother.

1009
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,293
You look just like him.

1010
01:12:24,918 --> 01:12:26,583
What do you think? Same-same?

1011
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,309
- What do you mean?
- He looks like my husband.

1012
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:29,333
Same, same.

1013
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,208
I look like Peter, right?

1014
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,250
Oh no!

1015
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:34,918
What's that?

1016
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:37,708
What's this sound?

1017
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:51,418
That's by the TV station.

1018
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,375
Yeah, I think so.

1019
01:12:53,418 --> 01:12:58,000
Bro! People are gathering
over by the TV station!

1020
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:01,083
The taxi drivers are all
heading there, too.

1021
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,958
- Really?
- I'll see you there.

1022
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:08,543
<i>Night of May 20, 1980
Near Gwang-ju MBC TV Station</i>

1023
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:45,918
The foreign reporter! Get the radio!

1024
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,293
Jae-sik!

1025
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:28,543
Mister, look out!

1026
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:31,418
They're plainclothes soldiers!

1027
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:33,958
What? Plainclothes?

1028
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,500
Damned commies!

1029
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,583
Go hide up there. I'll bring it up.

1030
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:19,958
Hurry!

1031
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:38,583
Where is he?

1032
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:43,333
He didn't come this way.

1033
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:54,458
Hello!

1034
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,708
I know you're up there.

1035
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,293
Mister.

1036
01:16:04,168 --> 01:16:07,043
If you give me the camera and film,

1037
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,043
you two,

1038
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:10,333
no...

1039
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:15,500
the three of you including this kid...

1040
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:18,418
can go free.

1041
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,375
What is he saying?

1042
01:16:33,543 --> 01:16:35,543
I'll count to ten.

1043
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,083
And I'll let you decide

1044
01:16:40,918 --> 01:16:42,583
what the wise choice is.

1045
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,418
He wants this.

1046
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:48,043
Then we can live, and Jae-sik too.

1047
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:49,668
Give safe.

1048
01:16:50,418 --> 01:16:53,043
Let's give it to him.

1049
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,875
One,

01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:57,375

eight,

nine...

1058
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:27,958
Wait a minute!

1059
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:34,500
The foreign reporter might be close by.

1060
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:37,418
Let me speak in English to him.

1061
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:43,043
I'll beg him to save me.

1062
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:58,875
Can you hear me?

1063
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,668
I can't hold this soldier much longer.

1064
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:11,583
So please,

1065
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:16,375
go now and show the world
what's happening in here.

1066
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,083
- Where are you going?
- So please...

1067
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,418
We need to give him this.

1068
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,500
They're coming up!

1069
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,833
Hey!

1070
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:34,418
Damn!

1071
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:36,708
Give me the bag!

1072
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,833
Get away!

1073
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,125
I'm okay!

1074
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Over there!

1075
01:18:47,168 --> 01:18:48,168
Get him!

1076
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:08,708
There!

1077
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,375
Where's the damn reporter?

1078
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,875
Where are you running, commie?

1079
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,875
Spare me, I'm not a commie!

1080
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,958
You prick! Damn commie!

1081
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:55,918
I'm really not a commie!

1082
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,000
I'm not even from Gwang-ju. I'm from Seoul.

1083
01:20:59,043 --> 01:21:02,708
#10-8, Hwayang-dong 384,
Sungdong-gu, Seoul.

1084
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:07,750
Yeah.

1085
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:10,208
I know.

1086
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,918
The Seoul taxi.

1087
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:17,500
You're that commie who brought
in the German reporter.

1088
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:21,083
The shit bastard who sold
his country for money!

1089
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:25,418
And yet you say, "I'm not a commie!"

1090
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,750
"I'm not a commie!"

1091
01:21:27,793 --> 01:21:29,375
"I'm not a commie!"

1092
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,293
"I'm not a commie!"

1093
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,125
How dare you...

1094
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:58,875
We have to get out of here.

1095
01:22:09,543 --> 01:22:11,418
My god, I was so worried!

1096
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:15,668
I'm glad you made it back.
But where's Jae-sik?

1097
01:22:16,793 --> 01:22:18,208
Wasn't he with you?

1098
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:20,543
Huh?

1099
01:22:48,543 --> 01:22:49,708
You know...

1100
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:56,750
I earned some money in Saudi Arabia.

1101
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,293
But my wife got sick and I spent
it all on hospital bills.

1102
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:08,625
At the end, my wife insisted
that I buy that taxi.

1103
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:13,833
And the doctor said so too,

1104
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,293
so I should look after our daughter.

1105
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:29,918
We could have tried more meds,

1106
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:39,000
but I didn't argue. That's
the kind of guy I am.

1107
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,293
The rest have to go on living, right?

1108
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:53,083
Because after my wife died,
I got drunk every day.

1109
01:24:02,293 --> 01:24:07,500
One day I woke up,

1110
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:19,583
she was crying holding onto
her mom's old clothes.

1111
01:24:27,668 --> 01:24:29,668
She must have missed her so much.

1112
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:40,458
I quit drinking that day.

1113
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,875
I'm the only one she has left.

1114
01:25:57,918 --> 01:25:59,208
What are you doing?

1115
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:05,043
The paratroopers are
searching for a Seoul taxi!

1116
01:26:05,418 --> 01:26:08,500
Should've said you're going.
You don't even know the roads!

1117
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:11,833
Here, take this and...

1118
01:26:15,793 --> 01:26:20,750
These are hidden roads out of Gwang-ju.

1119
01:26:23,043 --> 01:26:26,208
And the reporter asked me to give you this.

1120
01:26:27,043 --> 01:26:29,125
How can I accept that?

1121
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,333
What?

1122
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:34,043
If a driver took a passenger,
he should accept the fare!

1123
01:26:34,168 --> 01:26:36,000
Just take it.

1124
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,708
I can't take that money.

1125
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:42,043
Just the repairs will cost you a lot.

1126
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:44,458
Don't argue. Just take it!

1127
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,833
On your way, now.

1128
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:51,458
Your daughter must have
waited all night. Hurry.

1129
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:57,333
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1130
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:03,043
Why are you sorry?

1131
01:27:03,543 --> 01:27:05,458
Bastards out there should be.

1132
01:27:14,543 --> 01:27:17,918
It's damn fine weather.

1133
01:27:22,793 --> 01:27:26,833
Come visit with your daughter someday.

1134
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,333
We'll take my son and go on a picnic.

1135
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:34,000
Take care of yourself.

1136
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,958
You take care.

1137
01:28:36,418 --> 01:28:38,333
It'll take an hour to fix it.

1138
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,625
Don't stay cramped in here.

1139
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:45,418
There's a Buddha's day celebration
or something like that over there.

1140
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:46,918
Go take a walk around.

1141
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,208
Can I use the phone?

1142
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:03,708
<i>Hello?</i>

1143
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,458
Dong-su, is my daughter there?

1144
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,375
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1145
01:29:07,418 --> 01:29:08,543
Is she with you?

1146
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:11,625
<i>She just fell asleep. Wake her up?</i>

1147
01:29:11,668 --> 01:29:13,418
No, let her sleep.

1148
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,375
Is she okay?

1149
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:18,918
<i>If you're so worried, why did you stay out?</i>

1150
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:21,625
<i>Did you really get that money?</i>

1151
01:29:21,668 --> 01:29:22,793
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

1152
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:26,375
<i>Mr. Kim! Where are you?</i>

1153
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,125
I'm...

1154
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,958
I'm in the countryside
and my car broke down.

1155
01:29:32,418 --> 01:29:36,708
I left 2,000 won in my drawer.
Please give it to Eunjung...

1156
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,458
<i>She's been up all night waiting,
so why make promises!</i>

1157
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,333
<i>Hey, give me the phone!</i>

1158
01:29:43,918 --> 01:29:47,793
<i>You'll be back soon? Let's talk then.
Stop it!</i>

1159
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:07,875
Hello!

1160
01:30:11,918 --> 01:30:13,418
How old is your daughter?

1161
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:14,250
Eleven.

1162
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:16,918
Then how about these?

1163
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:22,000
These are sturdy and nice. Moms love them.

1164
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,543
They're really popular!

1165
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:30,125
If she's 11, she'll need size 200...

1166
01:30:30,168 --> 01:30:31,708
Give me size 210.

1167
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:34,000
Size 200 is getting small for her.

1168
01:30:34,043 --> 01:30:38,833
What a thoughtful father.
You know her shoe size!

1169
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:42,543
Those are a bit expensive...

1170
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,293
A bowl of noodles, please.

1171
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,293
Huh? I thought you went bill collecting?

1172
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:00,583
Ended up wasting my time.

1173
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,418
Ma'am, another bottle of soju!

1174
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:03,333
Sure.

1175
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,668
What, people wouldn't pay?

1176
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,168
I couldn't even get into Gwang-ju.

1177
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,043
I heard people were killed
in Gwang-ju, I guess it's true!

1178
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:14,000
People were killed?

1179
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:18,418
Yeah, soldiers raided the city,
and all hell broke loose.

1180
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:19,375
What are you talking about?

1181
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:20,793
I don't know for sure,

1182
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:26,083
but I heard many people were killed,
and a whole bunch arrested.

1183
01:31:26,125 --> 01:31:28,418
That's not it.

1184
01:31:28,793 --> 01:31:33,250
A few innocent soldiers were killed in
violent college student protests.

1185
01:31:33,293 --> 01:31:37,793
No, someone really saw
people getting killed there.

1186
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:39,500
It was in the news.

1187
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:43,793
Not just students, but hardcore Communists.

1188
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:46,083
They even brought gangsters from Seoul!

1189
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,668
Really? It was in the news?

1190
01:31:50,293 --> 01:31:51,625
Yeah!

1191
01:31:51,793 --> 01:31:54,668
It's in the newspaper
too, a full-page story.

1192
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:59,208
If they want to protest,
why not just do it in Seoul?

1193
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,833
<i>Protests in Gwang-ju</i>
Keeping me from doing my job.

1194
01:32:04,793 --> 01:32:08,543
<i>Rogue Groups and Rioters...</i>

1195
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:42,375
You must've been really hungry.
Have this, too.

1196
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,208
It's delicious... Delicious.

1197
01:33:03,668 --> 01:33:05,543
Taxi, taxi!

1198
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,918
So pretty.

1199
01:33:15,668 --> 01:33:19,083
Always bought her sneakers,
never a nice pair of shoes...

1200
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:21,583
Eun-jung will love these.

One more phone call, please.

1212
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,458
Eun-jung, are you awake?

1213
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:06,083
<i>Daddy, are we going on a picnic?</i>

1214
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,708
Sorry, there's something I need to do.

1215
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,168
Let's go another time.

1216
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:14,875
<i>When?</i>

1217
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,750
I left a customer behind.

1218
01:35:22,043 --> 01:35:24,833
Someone who really needs to take my taxi.

1219
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:28,125
I'll come home right after.

1220
01:35:28,168 --> 01:35:31,583
So, be nice and don't fight with Sang-gu.

1221
01:35:46,418 --> 01:35:57,458
Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away
and the East Sea's waters run dry,

1222
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:07,208
God protect and preserve our country.

1223
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:16,875
Where has he gone?

1224
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:18,708
To the hospital.

1225
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,083
The hospital?

1226
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:02,458
Why are you back?

1227
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:30,875
The paratroopers dragged him off,

1228
01:37:33,418 --> 01:37:36,875
and he died on the way.

1229
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:42,043
So they just threw him in a rice field.

1230
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,875
There aren't enough coffins in Gwang-ju.

1231
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:51,418
So some students went to get more...

1232
01:38:33,543 --> 01:38:34,793
Why are you sitting there?

1233
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:40,000
You need to record all this.

1234
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:49,168
You promised, to tell people.

1235
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:54,958
It needs to be broadcast
so people will know.

1236
01:38:56,793 --> 01:38:58,500
You're a reporter, shoot this.

1237
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:02,625
Jae-sik, and this too.

1238
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:04,500
Here.

1239
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:50,750
Open your eyes!

1240
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,125
How can you leave me

1241
01:40:01,543 --> 01:40:04,125
and our unborn baby!

1242
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:17,293
Make way!

1243
01:40:17,793 --> 01:40:20,458
Over here, Doctor! Please help over here.

1244
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,750
He's been shot.

1245
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,125
Bro, what do we do?

1246
01:40:26,458 --> 01:40:30,125
They're really trying to wipe us all out!

1247
01:40:30,168 --> 01:40:32,208
People were singing the national anthem,

1248
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:35,208
when the paratroopers
just started shooting.

1249
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:37,543
God, so many people have been shot!

1250
01:40:37,918 --> 01:40:39,918
We need to get there.

1251
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,543
You two go to Seoul, quickly.

1252
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,418
I'm coming with you!

1253
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,208
Mr. Kim, you go back to Seoul.
I need to keep filming.

1254
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,375
Hey, hey.

1255
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,833
You paid me the fare.

1256
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:52,750
We go together.

1257
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,458
I taxi driver,

1258
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,333
you taxi customer.

1259
01:40:57,293 --> 01:40:58,293
Okay?

1260
01:40:58,918 --> 01:41:00,208
Okay! Together.

1261
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,208
<i>Dear citizens of Gwang-ju.</i>

1262
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:41,090
<i>One, stay at home.
Two, don't believe rumors.</i>

1263
01:41:41,918 --> 01:41:42,958
He needs hospital, now!

1264
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,418
Get ahold of yourself!

1265
01:41:54,168 --> 01:41:56,793
Why are they shooting us?

1266
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:06,625
Don't go out.

1267
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,333
My god, look at that.

1268
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,958
What's going on here?

1269
01:42:21,293 --> 01:42:22,833
Over there! She's shot!

1270
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:57,125
Get a hold of yourself!

1271
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:23,833
How can they just shoot people?

1272
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,583
How can they do this to us?

1273
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:30,750
How many times has it been?

1274
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:33,543
They really plan to kill us all!

1275
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:37,125
We can't leave injured people like that!

1276
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:42,583
That's it. Let's drive our taxis in.

1277
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:44,750
Wait...

1278
01:43:49,543 --> 01:43:50,543
Here.

1279
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:55,293
I can drive well. Let's go together.

1280
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,543
Look! The taxi drivers!

1281
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,083
Thank you.

1282
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:45,500
Young-pyo!

1283
01:45:47,168 --> 01:45:49,418
- Young-pyo!
- Are you okay?

1284
01:45:49,958 --> 01:45:51,125
Hey, duck down.

1285
01:45:51,168 --> 01:45:52,333
Let's help them!

1286
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:56,625
Let's save the wounded! Come on!

1287
01:46:03,668 --> 01:46:06,125
- Don't lose focus.
- Come here.

1288
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,125
Are you okay?

1289
01:46:10,293 --> 01:46:11,625
Please help me!

1290
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:19,583
Bro, get in here!

1291
01:46:20,918 --> 01:46:22,000
Gently!

1292
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:44,418
Here, over here!

1293
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:46,043
Hold on a sec.

1294
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:40,583
You need to go now.

1295
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,333
They're getting closer.

1296
01:48:42,375 --> 01:48:45,125
You have to go now.
Or it will be impossible.

1297
01:48:45,668 --> 01:48:47,875
Let us take care of this.

1298
01:48:48,375 --> 01:48:53,293
Go back, and please,
prove all their lies wrong!

1299
01:48:53,333 --> 01:48:57,208
We cannot do it, but you can.
Please, for us.

1300
01:49:02,543 --> 01:49:05,418
Go quickly! Things are getting bad here.

1301
01:50:11,168 --> 01:50:13,000
Mr. Kim, we must go now.

1302
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:41,043
Block all checkpoints.

1303
01:50:57,918 --> 01:50:59,043
Can you get us out?

1304
01:51:01,875 --> 01:51:02,875
Don't worry.

1305
01:51:04,458 --> 01:51:06,668
I'll get you to the airport no matter what.

1306
01:51:54,418 --> 01:51:55,668
Good afternoon.

1307
01:51:57,333 --> 01:51:58,418
Where are you going?

1308
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,668
I'm taking a customer to Seoul.

1309
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:01,833
Is it a Seoul taxi?

1310
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,293
No, a Gwang-ju taxi.

1311
01:52:05,625 --> 01:52:06,708
Where's your home?

1312
01:52:08,293 --> 01:52:09,418
Why?

1313
01:52:09,458 --> 01:52:11,500
Answer, you bastard!

1314
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:14,293
And why don't you have a Gwang-ju accent?

1315
01:52:15,708 --> 01:52:17,793
I moved here not long ago.

1316
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,625
What's going on? Why are you stopping us?

1317
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:28,250
Hey, college boy! What's
this bastard saying?

1318
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:32,208
Where are you going?

1319
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,293
I'm here on business.

1320
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:37,375
But it's so dangerous in Gwang-ju,
you know all these riots?

1321
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,668
So we go back to Seoul.

1322
01:52:40,293 --> 01:52:42,500
He came on business but
leaving to escape the riots.

1323
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:51,543
Both of you, out of the car.

1324
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:54,168
I don't understand. What's the problem?

1325
01:52:55,168 --> 01:52:56,168
Get out now.

1326
01:52:56,875 --> 01:53:00,500
Being a foreigner won't save you. Get out.

1327
01:53:22,293 --> 01:53:23,500
Open the trunk.

1328
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,333
These are his souvenirs.

1329
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:52,208
From Buddha's Birthday.

1330
01:54:23,293 --> 01:54:24,293
Let them through.

1331
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:29,583
Sergeant, we have to stop all foreigners.

1332
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:32,168
He's not a reporter, and
it's not a Seoul taxi.

1333
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,125
Let them through.

1334
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,625
I said, let them through.

1335
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:42,125
Yes, sir.

1336
01:55:09,458 --> 01:55:11,333
They said to stop taxis with foreigners!

1337
01:55:11,375 --> 01:55:12,668
Hey, close it!

1338
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:24,625
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1339
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:26,083
Plate number 0310.

1340
01:55:26,793 --> 01:55:29,083
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1341
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:31,875
Plate number 0310.

1342
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:52,583
This is awesome.

1343
01:57:02,958 --> 01:57:04,041
Run them over.

1344
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:18,791
Bastards!

1345
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,625
Shoot them all!

1346
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,250
Damn it!

1347
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,041
Bro, go faster!

1348
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:35,958
Don't worry about me!

1349
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:13,458
Come on bastards, let's go at it!

1350
01:58:37,041 --> 01:58:38,583
What's going on back there?

1351
01:58:57,416 --> 01:58:58,750
I'm sorry...

1352
01:59:16,083 --> 01:59:17,625
Take care of yourself!

1353
01:59:18,083 --> 01:59:19,791
Don't worry about us!

1354
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:51,708
Step on it.

1355
01:59:52,375 --> 01:59:53,375
Step on it!

1356
02:01:40,041 --> 02:01:43,250
Yes, we're searching everywhere.
Don't worry, sir.

1357
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:46,083
He called the airport just now
and reserved a flight.

1358
02:01:47,666 --> 02:01:49,041
Commander, we found him!

1359
02:01:49,083 --> 02:01:51,333
He booked the 10am plane to Japan tomorrow.

1360
02:01:52,458 --> 02:01:53,833
Yes, sir!

1361
02:01:53,875 --> 02:01:54,875
Hi.

1362
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,166
Mr. Hinzpeter?

1363
02:01:58,208 --> 02:01:59,208
Yes.

1364
02:02:00,958 --> 02:02:05,166
Our system shows that you have a flight
booked for tomorrow at 10am?

1365
02:02:05,208 --> 02:02:07,333
Yes, but I'm somehow here today,

1366
02:02:07,375 --> 02:02:12,333
so I'd like to get onto the first flight
out to Japan and make it first class.

1367
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,791
For your daughter.

1368
02:02:58,916 --> 02:03:00,125
This is for me?

1369
02:03:01,125 --> 02:03:02,125
Thank you.

1370
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:05,000
Please give me your phone number.

1371
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:06,541
What?

1372
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:09,208
Your taxi. I'd like to
pay for all the damage.

1373
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:13,500
I'll get the news broadcast,
then come right back to Korea.

1374
02:03:14,083 --> 02:03:15,708
I'll call you when I return.

1375
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:22,291
Ah, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

1376
02:03:24,541 --> 02:03:25,541

You... you good job too.

1383

02:04:22,291 --> 02:04:23,291
Okay.

1386
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,500
Go on.

02:05:30,541 --> 02:05:32,083
The curfew starts soon.

1388
02:05:32,416 --> 02:05:35,541
Did your dad run off? Cause he's so poor?

1389
02:05:37,583 --> 02:05:40,750
Sang-gu! Stop bothering your friend!

1390
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,916
But she hit me first!

1391
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:45,708

I'm sorry.

1396
02:06:40,375 --> 02:06:42,083

02:08:34,583 --> 02:08:39,333
It is a great honor for me to
receive this award here in Korea.

1415
02:08:40,333 --> 02:08:44,416
I still remember the faces of
the citizens I met in Gwang-ju,

1416
02:08:45,125 --> 02:08:47,750
that spring of 1980.

1417
02:08:50,083 --> 02:08:52,041
And I will never forget.

1418
02:08:56,083 --> 02:09:01,083
But there is one face
in particular that I miss dearly.

1419
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:06,333
My brave friend, Kim Sa-bok.

1420
02:09:08,375 --> 02:09:09,625
He is a taxi driver.

1421
02:09:16,125 --> 02:09:17,333
Hey.

1422
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:18,583
Hey, young man!

1423
02:09:19,125 --> 02:09:21,416
Sorry, sir. I only have 10,000 won.

1424
02:09:21,458 --> 02:09:23,500
That's fine. Go on.

1425
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:26,750
Thank you!

1426
02:09:26,791 --> 02:09:28,041
Watch your step.

1427
02:09:38,875 --> 02:09:40,708
Hey, wait!

1428
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:44,708
<i>Without him, news of the Gwang-ju Uprising</i>

1429
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:45,809
<i>would have never reached the world.</i>

1430
02:09:45,833 --> 02:09:46,916
Oh my.

1431
02:09:48,583 --> 02:09:51,833
<i>I'm afraid my words fail
to express my gratitude,</i>

1432
02:09:52,291 --> 02:09:54,416
<i>but you're always in my thoughts.</i>

1433
02:09:54,458 --> 02:09:58,125
<i>Mr. Kim, my dear friend.</i>

1434
02:10:00,083 --> 02:10:01,083
<i>Thank you.</i>

1435
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:04,166
I've missed you.

1436
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:10,791
I'll keep waiting.

1437
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:15,166
I hope to see you again soon.

1438
02:10:19,291 --> 02:10:22,791
<i>He said if not for Kim Sa-bok's help
he could never have made the report,</i>

1439
02:10:22,833 --> 02:10:24,583
<i>and he wishes to see him again.</i>

1440
02:10:24,625 --> 02:10:26,541
I'm more grateful to you.

1441
02:10:28,291 --> 02:10:29,833
Thank you, thank you.

1442
02:10:30,708 --> 02:10:32,833
I wanted to see you again, too.

1443
02:10:34,416 --> 02:10:36,041
At least I see you like this.

1444
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:39,958
You've grown old too.

1445
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,583
Hello, where to?

1446
02:10:59,625 --> 02:11:01,125
To Gwanghwamun, please.

1447
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,833
Gwanghwamun, okay.

1448
02:12:06,458 --> 02:12:11,250
It would be truly wonderful
if I could meet you again.

1449
02:12:16,666 --> 02:12:21,250
Oh... really, I'd be happy beyond words.

1450
02:12:31,041 --> 02:12:37,958
If I could find you through this footage,

1451
02:12:39,208 --> 02:12:43,500
and then meet you once again,

1452
02:12:44,875 --> 02:12:47,916
I would just be so happy.

1453
02:12:48,083 --> 02:12:53,500
I'd rush over to Seoul in an instant,

1454
02:12:53,791 --> 02:13:02,875
ride with you in your taxi,
and see the new Korea.
