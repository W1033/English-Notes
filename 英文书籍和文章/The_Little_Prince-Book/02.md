## Chapter2

** -The narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance 相识 of 结识某人the little prince **

> crash /kræʃ/ ,

飞机被撞毁在沙漠里，解说员，认识了小王了。

So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone (completely alone). It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

我一直孤独的生活，没有一个可以真正交心的，直到六年前我在撒哈拉沙事故坠机，发动机里损坏了一个什么东西。，既没有机械师，也没有任何乘客，完完全全是我一个人，我想尽一切办法艰难的修理它。我仅有维持一周的饮用水，对我来说是个生死攸关的问题。

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:

"If you please, draw me a sheep绵羊!"

"What!"

"Draw me a sheep!"

> isolate  /'aɪsəlɪt/, v,使隔离；使孤立 adj. 隔离的；孤立的

> shipwreck /'ʃɪprɛk/, n,遇难船;  v ,使失事；使毁灭；使失败

第一个晚上，我睡在远离人烟千里之外的沙漠中，比遇难后的水手更加孤立无援，至少他们还有个筏子在海上漂着。在日出时分，我被一个奇怪的，小小的声音唤醒，所以你可以想象我有多震惊，。

『请你，画一只羊给我吧。』

『什么？』

『为我画一只羊！』

I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked (wink the eye, 眨眼睛) my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. 

> blink  /blɪŋk/,  shut your eyes and very quickly open them again. 

> thunderstruck  /'θʌndɚ'strʌk/,as if struck dumb with astonishment and surprise

我如遭雷劈般跳了起来，艰难地眨了眨眼，仔细地环视周围，发现一个非同寻常的小人，严肃地站在那儿望着我。这里你可以看到我后来给他画的最好的一幅画像，可是，画像一定是远不如他本人那么有魅力。

That, however,is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas (boa = boa constrictor) from the outside and boas from the inside.

然而，这不是我的错，在我六岁的时候，哪些大人们让我对绘画生涯感到灰心，之后我再也没有学过画，除了那个看不到和看得到肚子里的大蟒蛇。

Now I stared at this sudden apparition (ghost, spirit, .鬼，幽灵) **with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment**. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying 迷路uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But ... what are you doing here?" 

> stare at 注视，with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment 修饰spparition 的定语。
> 
> apparition ,a remarkable or unexpected appearance of someone or something, 表示出现令人惊奇的人或事
> 
> start = give a small jump from surprise or alarm 形容我的眼睛因为吃惊快掉下来了，“眼珠子都给我惊掉了”。

我盯着这个幽灵一样突然出现在我眼里差点让我惊掉眼珠子的小家伙。要知道，我现在深陷远离居民区千里之外的沙漠里。这个小家伙看上去既不像在沙漠里迷路了，也没有疲劳、饥渴、昏厥的恐惧，没有迹象表明这是个在荒无人烟的大漠中迷路的孩子。当我从惊讶中缓过来可以说话的时候，我问他：『呃...你来这干什么？』

And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please, draw me a sheep."

可他慢斯条理地，像是在说一件非常重大的事情，重复道：『请，给我画一只羊。』

When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey （ obey服从）. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography,history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly (angrily), too) that I did not knowhow to draw.He answered me: "That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep."

当一件事过于强大到把你镇住时，你不敢不服从。在这荒无人烟危机四伏的沙漠中，尽管这样的举动很是荒谬，我还是从口袋中拿出钢笔和一张纸，可我又记起我的学习生涯早已被地理，历史，算术和语法填满，我告诉这小家伙说我不会画画。他却说：『没关系，给我画只羊吧。』

But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with. "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome 笨拙的. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."So then I made a drawing. 

我从来没有画过一只羊，所以我就给他画了我经常画的两幅画，那只看不到肚子里面的大蟒蛇。『不，不，不，我不要大蟒蛇，他肚子里还装着一头大象！蟒蛇太危险了，大象又笨拙又占地方，我住的地方很小的，我需要一只羊，给我画一只羊吧。』我听了这个小家伙的话，非常惊讶，于是，我给他画了一只羊。

He looked at it carefully, then he said: "No. This sheep is already very sickly.Make me another."
So I made another drawing.

他非常细心的看完说：『不，这只羊看起来病怏怏的，重画一次吧。』于是我又画了一幅。

My friend smiled gently and indulgently. "You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram 公羊. It has horns."

So then I did my drawing over once more.

我的朋友温和地笑了，『你自己看』，他说：『这不是绵羊，是一只公羊，还有犄角呢。』我不得不又画了一幅。

But it was rejected (refuse, turn down, 拒绝 , 否决 ) too, just like the others. "This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time." 

但是和前几幅一样被拒绝了，『这只太老了，我需要一只活的久一点的羊。』

By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off (do quickly) this drawing.And I threw out an explanation with it. "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."

但是这次，我的耐心被耗尽了，因为我急于开始拆开我的发动机，这次我匆匆结束了这幅画，对他说：『这只是一只盒子，你要的小羊就待在里边。』

I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:

"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"

"Why?"

"Because where I live everything is very small."

"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."

He bent his head over the drawing:

"Not so small that. Look! He has gone to sleep."

And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince. 

小家伙的脸上露出了笑容，我对此感到吃惊，『这正是我想要的，你说这只羊会吃很多很多草吗？』

『为什么这么问？』

『因为我住的地方非常小。』

『肯定有足够的草够它吃呢』，我说，『我给你画的是非常小一只羊。』

他低下头来看这幅画，『也不是那么小，看，他已经去睡觉了。』

就这样，我认识了小王子。
