## Chapter 12

**-The little prince visits the tippler 酒鬼, drunkard, (tipple - drink alcohol)**



The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.

"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.

"I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious [lluː'guːbrɪəs] (sad, sorrowful) air.

"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.

"So that I may forget," replied the tippler.

"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.

"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head 低/垂下头.

"Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.

"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable 无法攻破的silence.

And the little prince went away,puzzled.

"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself,as he continued on his journey.
