## Chapter 3

**-The narrator learns more about from where the little prince came**

It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance (by accident) that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.

> reveal ,/ri'vi:l/ ,make clear and visible ;disclose directly or through prophets,EX:God rarely reveal his plans for Mankind

弄清楚小王子从哪里来，花费了我很长时间，这个问了我好多问题的小王子，似乎从来听不到我问他的问题，从他偶然的只言片语，一点点地，事实清晰地拼凑了起来。

The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: "What is that object?"

"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane." And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.

He cried out then: "What! You dropped down from the sky?"

"Yes," I answered, modestly.

"Oh! That is funny!"

比如说，在他第一次见到我的飞机，他问我：『这是个什么东西？』

『这不是东西，它可以飞，它是架飞机，我的飞机。』我很骄傲让他知道我学过开飞机可以飞。

他却惊呼起来：『啊，你从天上掉下来？』

『是的』，我谦逊地回答他。

『噢！那应该很好玩！』

And the little prince broke into (begin suddenly) a lovely peal (ring of a bell) of laughter,which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.

Then he added: "So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"

> irritate , /ˈɪrɪˌteɪt/,cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations;excite to an abnormal condition, of chafe or inflame 
> misfortune, /mɪsˈfɔːtʃən/, something unpleasant or unlucky that happens to someone.

可是小王子却突然爆发出一串可爱的银铃般的笑声，让我感觉非常不快。我以为他能认真地看待我的不幸。

他接着说：『所以，你也是从天上来了！是从哪个星球？』

At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable (penetrate, 看穿 /透 , 渗透 ) mystery of his presence, and I demanded, abruptly: "Do you come from another planet?"

But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: "It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away."

> gleam ,shine brightly, like a star or a light;appear briefly; A gleam of something is a faint sign of it. 
>
>penetrate   /'penitreit/,come to understand;pass into or through, often by overcoming resistance ;become clear or enter one's consciousness or emotions , impenetrate   /im'penitreit/
>
> abrupt，marked by sudden changes in subject and sharp transitions；exceedingly sudden and unexpected；

就在那一刻，我灵光一闪，仿偷窥到了他出现在这里的秘密，我唐突地问到：『你来自另一个星球？』

但是他没有回答。他轻轻地甩了下他的头，视线一直没有离开我的飞机：『可不是么，你不可能从很远的地方来。』

And he sank into a reverie ['revərɪ] 沉思, which lasted a long time.

Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation (注视) of his treasure.

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half confidence ((偷偷吐露的)秘密 about the 'other planets.' I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.

"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live', of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"

> bury sb in sth,
>
> arouse  /əˈraʊz/ ,call forth (emotions, feelings, and responses) 
> 
> make effort ,do one's best

他长时间地陷入了沉思。接着，他从口袋中掏出了我画的小羊，盯着他的宝贝出了神。

你可以想象我被这个不吐不快的所谓另一个星球 的勾起了好奇心，我努力地想知道更多。

『小家伙，你从哪里来，你说的‘你住的地方’ 在哪里？你要把你的羊带回哪里去？』

After a reflective (thoughtful) silence he answered: "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."

"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."

他沉思了一会回答我说：『你给我的那个箱子很好，这样晚上小羊就可以当屋子用。』

『那当然，如果你想，我还可以给你一条绳子，这样，你白天就可以栓住它，栓在桩子上。』

But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: "Tie him! What a queer (strange) idea!"

"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere,and get lost."

My friend broke into another peal of laughter: "But where do you think he would go?"

"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."

Then the little prince said, earnestly: "That doesn't matter.Where I live, everything is so small!"

And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far." 

不过看起来我的建议让小王子很吃惊，『栓住它！多么奇怪的想法！』

『如果你不栓住他，它会到处乱跑，会跑丢的。』

我的小朋友又突然笑了起来，『他能跑到哪里去呀？』

『任何地方，一直朝前跑就是了。』

这时，小王子认真地说：『那没关系的，我住的地方很小。』

接着，带着一丝伤感，他补充了一句：『就算一只朝前跑，也跑不出多远。』
