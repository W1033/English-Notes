## Chapter 4

**The narrator speculates 推/猜测as to which asteroid 小行星 from which the little prince came.**

I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!

我还了解到了另一个非常重要的事：这就是小王子居住的星球比房子几乎大不了多少！

But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets — such as the Earth, Jupiter 木星, Mars火星, Venus 金星 — to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time (has difficulty) seeing them through the telescope (tele+scope). When an astronomer 天文学家 discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325." 

但这并没有多么奇怪的，除了大的星球如地球，木星，火星，金星，这些有自己名字的，我知道还有上百个其他星球，有的星球小到望远镜很难观测到。当某个天文学家发现的时候，就给了一个数字编号而不是名字，比如，他们可能叫它，“行星325”。

I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.

> asteroid  /'æstərɔɪd/, n.any of numerous small celestial bodies composed of rock and metal that move around the sun (mainly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter); adj. shaped like a star;  ex, asteroid belt小行星带
> astronomer,/ə'strɑnəmɚ/,  a physicist who studies astronomy

我有足够的理由相信，小王子居住的星球，就是被编号 B-612 的星球，这颗星球仅仅在1909年，被一名土耳其天文学家通过望远镜观测到一次。

On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration 演示论证. But he was in Turkish costume , and so nobody would believe what he said.Grown-ups are like that...

在一次国际天文会议上，这个天文学家对他的发现做了重要论证，但是因为他身着土耳其服饰，并没有人相信他说的话。大人们总是这样...

Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance . And this time everybody accepted his report.

> demonstrate ，/'dɛmən'stret/,prove / give evidence of,show or demonstrate something to an interested audience, EX. To demonstrate a fact means to make it clear to people.

然而幸运的是，土耳其的一位独裁者，为了B-612星球的荣誉，下令他的臣民改穿欧洲服饰，违令者死。之后在1920年 这位天文学家，穿着高雅的让人印象深刻的欧式衣服，重新给出了实证，这一次，所有人都同意他的看法。

If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of  the grown ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?"Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.

> on account of , because of /from / by reason of / for the reason

我告诉你们关于这颗星球的细节，列举这些数字给你，主要是因为那些大人，他们就喜欢数字。当你告诉他们，你交了新朋友，他们从来不会问一些重要问题，从来不会对你说：『他的声音好不好听？他最喜欢玩什么游戏？他喜欢收集蝴蝶吗？』相反的，他们会问：『他多大了？家里还有些什么人？他有多重？他爸爸赚多少钱？』只有通过这些数字，他们以为只有通过这些数字才能了解一个人。

If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"

如果你对他们说，『我看到一座美丽的房子，玫瑰色的石砖，窗户有天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子』，他们根本感觉不到屋子有多漂亮。你应该这样说：『我看到一所价值两万美金的房子』，那样他们才会惊呼，『哇，那房子该有多漂亮啊！』

Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.

> hold against ,let their actions in the past influence your present attitude toward them and cause you to deal severely or unfairly with them. 因…而责怪

正因为如此，你可能要对他们这样说：『证明小王子存在就是他非常有魅力，他喜欢笑，他想要一只羊。如果有人想要一只羊，那就是小王子存在过。』之后他们会做什么？他们会耸耸肩膀，把你当一个小孩子看。可如果你这样说：『他来自B-612星球』，他们就深信不疑，不会对你提一大堆问题来纠缠。他们就是这样.小孩子们应该保持更大的宽容，不要责怪这些大人们。

But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep."To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.

> a matter of indifference , 无所谓的事，毫无差别，Success or failure should not be a matter of indifference to you. 

当然了，对于我们懂得生活的人，数字才没有那么重要。我喜欢以通话故事的形式来开始这个故事。我可以这样说：『很久以前，有个小王子，住在一颗比他自己大不了多少的星球上，他想要一只羊。』对于那些懂生活的人来说，这样说，才更贴近事实的真相。

For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly, I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures.

我可不希望有人漫不经心地读我的书，写下这些回忆我忍受着太多的哀伤。我的朋友带着他的小羊已经离开整整六年了，我不想忘记他，我尽力把他的故事写下来。忘记一个朋友是有多么悲伤，并不是每个人都曾有过一个朋友的。如果我忘记了他，我和那些大人们有什么区别，只知道数字对其他失去好奇心。

It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life  as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance (likeness， 相似) to its subject 对象. I make some errors, too, in the little
prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short.And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble  along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling .

> fair-to-middling , adj.,about average; acceptable

正因为如此，我又买了一盒颜料和一些铅笔，我在这个年纪，重新拿起画笔还真是有点困难，毕竟我只在六岁的时候只画过看得见肚皮和看不见肚皮里边的大蟒蛇再也没有画过任何东西了。我尽力的把他的画像画的尽可能逼真，可我还是没把握，有一张还可以，可另一张却一点也不像。对小王子的身高，我也拿不准，有些画的太高了，另外一些又太矮了。小王子服饰的颜色我也不确定，我笨手笨脚地摸索，有时好有时坏，我希望还能凑合着看。

In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas , do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.I have had to grow old. 

> in certain ,在某些 ex:in a certain way 有点儿 ; 在某种意义上 ; 一定的方式 ; 按一定的方法;in the certain degree 在一定程度

在某些重要的细节上，我也可能画错了。但那可能不是我的原因，我的朋友从来不会跟我解释任何事，也许他在想，他和我很像他自己吧，可我呢，哎，却不能透过盒子看到小羊。也许我有点像那些大人们了，不得不说我变老了。
