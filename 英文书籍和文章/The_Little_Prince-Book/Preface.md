The Little Prince

To Leon Werth

Preface

I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating 题献 it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.

He needs **cheering up** (encouragement, support). If all these reasons are not enough, I will **dedicate** the book **to** the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children — although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:
