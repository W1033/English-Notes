Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval . It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act (while doing something)  of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

> magnificent （[/mæɡ'nɪfɪk/]  wonderful
>
>  constrictor /kən'strɪktɚ/  [n.]，*boa constrictor*  王蛇；蟒蛇。近义词： snake, serpent, ophidian
>
> primeval（ [praɪ'mɪːvl] forest 原始森林）
>
> in the act  of doing-- (while doing something) 

在我6岁的时候，在《自然世界的真实故事》这本书中看到一张精彩绝伦的原始森林图片，画着一条大蟒蛇正在吞咽一只动物。下面是图片的副本。『』

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion 消化." 

>  prey :animal hunted or caught for food
>
> chew :[tʃʊ] ,biting and grinding food in your mouth so it becomes soft enough to swallow
>
> digest:[daɪ'dʒɛst],become assimilated into the body,**动词读作/dɪˈdʒɛst/。名词读作/ˈdaɪdʒɛst/**

书中说到：『大蟒蛇不加以咀嚼地囫囵吞咽他们捕食的猎物，之后，它们无法动弹，需要进入休眠状态长达六个月来进行消化。』

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

> pondered : /'pɑndɚ/ , think; consider

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

> pondered : /'pɑndɚ/ , think; consider

我不禁陷入深思，丛林冒险结束后，我做了一些工作，我用彩色铅笔成功地画出了我的第一幅作品，人生的第一幅作品，它看起来像这样：

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

> masterpiece : /'mæstəpis/  , the most outstanding work of a creative artist or craftsman， 

我展示我的杰作给大人们看，问这幅画是否吓到他们。但他们却回答说：『害怕？一顶帽子有什么可怕的呢？』

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing. I drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My drawing Number Two looked like this: 

可我画的不是一顶帽子呀。它是一条大蟒蛇正在消化一头大象。既然大人们不能理解，我又画了另一幅，为了让大人们看清楚，我把大蟒蛇内部画出来。他们总是需要去解释，我的第二幅画看起来这样：

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to **lay aside** (put aside，放到一边 ) my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.

> dishearten   /dɪs'hɑːt(ə)n/ ,take away the enthusiasm of

这一次，大人们的反应是，无论大蟒蛇的里边还是外边，让我把画大蟒蛇的事放在一边，让我全身心投入到地理，历史，算术和语法上。这就是为什么一个六岁的小男孩，放弃了没准能成为一个画家这样的一个精彩绝伦的职业。第一和第二这两幅画的失败让我感到气馁。

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves , and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

> tiresome  /'taɪɚsəm/, so lacking in interest as to cause mental weariness

大人们靠他们自己从来不会懂得太多，需要小孩子没完没了地给他们解释，好烦啊。

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. **At a glance** I can distinguish China from Arizona（美国） 亚利桑那州. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

> glance  **glance through** or **at** a newspaper.

这之后我选择了另一个职业，学习去做飞行员。我飞遍了世界的任何一个角落，事实上，地理真的有很大帮助。随意一瞥，我就能分辨出是中国还是亚利桑那州，如果在夜晚找不到航向，这些知识非常宝贵。

In the course of (during) this life I have had a great many encounters (meet, 遇见，邂逅) with a great many people who have been **concerned with** matters of consequence (= of importance = important). I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately 熟悉地;亲密地, close at hand (very close). And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.

> consequence  /'kɑnsəkwɛns/ ,having important effects or influence
>
> matters of consequence：要紧事； Matters Of Little Consequence ：琐碎之事

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear sighted (聪明的，精明的 ), I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he or she would always say: "That is a hat."

无论何时，如果遇到一个看起来聪明的人，我会尝试给他们看我保留着的第一幅画，看看这个人是否真的理解。但是，不管什么情况，他或者她大多都会说：『那是一顶帽子。』

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties(/'nɛk'tai/ 领带）. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. 

我再也不会跟人讨论大蟒蛇，原始森林，或者星星的事。尽量和他们一致，我会和他们谈桥牌啊，高尔夫啊，政治啊，甚至领带。当然他们会觉得遇到了如此通情达理的一个人。
